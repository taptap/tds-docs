## Q&A

### What is a test page? Why should I create a test page for my game? How to create a test page on TapTap?

The test page is a type of game page specifically for the test. After you created a page for your game, you can create a test page and link it to the game page for the official release. Notice that the test page does not support pre-registration.

When the test starts, users pre-registered for the release will receive the notification and be led to the test page. Ratings during the test is calculated separately from the ratings after the game is officially released. 

Ratings of your game after its release will not be affected by user reviews during the test. While your game is in testing, the game page for official release will still be open for pre-registration.

To create a test page for your game, send your request to[ international_operation@taptap.com](mailto:international_operation@taptap.com).

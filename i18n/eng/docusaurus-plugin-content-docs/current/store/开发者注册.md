## Q&A
### What is the difference between the business developer and the individual developer? Can I change from one to the other?

The specific type of your business will not be displayed to users. Regardless of your business type, your actions or access in Developer Center and TapTap will not differ at all.  

The only difference lies in the materials that is required for the application. 



You will not be able to change the selection of your business type. **Please be aware of it before you submit the application.**

### I am an independent developer. What should I fill in the title?  

We would recommend you to use the title of your team as the provider title instead of your own name.

### If the developer account already exists, what should I do? Can I claim it?

Please send your request to  [international_operation@taptap.com](mailto:international_operation@taptap.com). You will need to prove you have the right to make such change. And you will need to submit the developer application in the same provider name later.

### Do I have to start uploading games immediately after I have registered successfully?  

No.
  
We don’t have time requirements for creating games, so feel free to set up the game according to your own schedules. We do recommend you to upload the game soon so we can get stated as early as possible.

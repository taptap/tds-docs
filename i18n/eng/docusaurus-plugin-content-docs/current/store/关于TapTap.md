## **Crafting a Developer-centric platform**

Good content speaks for itself, and we are here to make sure that its voices don't go unheard. To help maximize exposure and facilitate organic discussions, we have completely removed service fees from TapTap so that 100% of game revenue goes directly to their creators. The platform also offers a robust suite of developer services so that developers themselves can focus on what they do bestâ€”creating captivating experiences. As more and more games turned into brands with homogeneous sequels, a group of passionate gamers created TapTap to combat franchise fatigue and inspire original, innovative, and compelling gaming experiences. Over the years, TapTap has helped many developers launch their projects and even more gamers discover them.

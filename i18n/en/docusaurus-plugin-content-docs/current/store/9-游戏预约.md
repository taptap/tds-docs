## **II. What are the benefits of pre-registration? **  

Players in TapTap usually pre-register for games that they are interested in. When the game is open for test or released for the first time, TapTap will push a notification to users who have pre-registered. These users are more possible to become players of this game.  
We recommend that providers take efforts to prepare materials and maintain Group and reviews to attract players to reserve games.

## **IV. Q&A**  

### **Can I change the title of the game? **  
Yes.  
To change the name of your game, please modify the game’s name and other information in the <Blue>Update Game</Blue> of the developer back end and submit the changes for review. When modifying the game name, remember to also modify the game’s icon, promotion image, screenshots and other related materials. The new title needs to be consistent with the title on the license. If you have updated the license and it involves authorization, you will need to provide relevant proof and to ensure the authorization chain is complete.  
After changing the game’s title, we recommend that you announce the original name and the reason for modifying the name in Notes or in the Group after modifying the name, so as not to confuse the players and affect the game rating.

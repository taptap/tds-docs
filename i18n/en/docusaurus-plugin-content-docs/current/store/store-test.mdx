## **IV. Q&A**  
### 1\. What is game test page? Why do I need a test page for my game? How to create a test page? **  
The test page is a game’s page created specifically for game testing. It is based on the page of the official release, and does not provide pre-registration services. In TapTap, ratings in the reviews during the test is calculated separately from the ratings after the game is officially available. When the game starts testing, a message will be pushed to the users who has pre-registered for the official release, and guide them to the test page to participate in the test.  

During the test, some defects of the game may cause the game to receive lower ratings. Separating the ratings during the test and after the release can, to a certain extent, avoid low ratings when the game is just release, and not affect applying for resource applications in TapTap later. During the test, the official release is still open for pre-registrations, which will help to attract more users to the game.   

If you need  to create a test page, please contact your TapTap operation staff in charge before the test, and the staff will set up the configuration for you.  


### **2\. After setting the release time for the pre-submitted APK at publishing settings, why is the game not open for test at the scheduled time? **  
The ‘Set As Current’ option will not change the status of the game. It can only change the APK currently available for download.  

If you need the test to start, please go to Developer Center, find <Blue>Change Release Status</Blue>, change the status to Testing and submit.  
If you are not able to perform the operation, or you need to change the status of the game at a specific time, please contact your TapTap operation staff in charge for assistance.  

We recommend you to inform the operation staff of any change to the game’s status so they could arrange pushing notifications or help you apply for resources.

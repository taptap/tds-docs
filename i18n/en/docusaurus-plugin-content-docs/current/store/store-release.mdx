## **IV. Q&A**  
### **After setting the release time for the pre-submitted APK at publishing settings, why is the game not open for download at the scheduled time? **  
The ‘Set As Current’ option will not change the status of the game. It can only change the APK currently available for download.  

If you need provide downloads, please go to Developer Center, find <Blue>Change Release Status</Blue>, change the status to Open for Download and submit.  
If you are not able to perform the operation, or you need to change the status of the game at a specific time, please contact your TapTap operation staff in charge for assistance.  

We recommend you to inform the operation staff of any change to the game’s status so they could arrange pushing notifications or help you apply for resources.

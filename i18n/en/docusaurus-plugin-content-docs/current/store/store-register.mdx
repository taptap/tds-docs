## **V. Q&A**  
### **1\. What is the difference between the business developer and the individual developer? Can I change from one to the other? **  
The type of developer, individual or business, will not be displayed to users. There is no difference in the actions in developer back end or in operating games in TapTap.  
The only difference is in the materials submitted for developer application. Individual developers will need to provider their personal information, while business developer need to provide company’s information.   
The above information can be viewed in Provider Info - Account Details after registration is completed.   

Right now TapTap does not support change from one type of developer to the other. **Please select the type of developer according to your actual situation.**  

### **2\. What should the individual developers fill in the provider title? **  
We suggest you use the title of your team or studio as the provider title instead of your own name, such as XXX Studio.

### **3\. If the developer title already exists, how should I claim it? **
Please send your request to  [operation@taptap.com](mailto:operation@taptap.com) with scanned copy of Business License or other proof that you are an official staff of this provider. And make a developer application in the same provider’s name.

**Template**  
> **<u>Subject</u>**  
> Application to claim TapTap provider account - XXX (provider title)  

> ---  

> Title and the link to the page of the provider to be claimed:  
> Scanned copy of business license of other proof materials <Gray>(which can be uploaded as attachments)</Gray>:  
> Contact of applicant:  

Once your developer application is a approved, it is considered that you have successfully claimed the account, and you will automatically become the provider’s Master Administrator.  
 TapTap’s operation staff will contact you within 2 business days after receiving your email. Please stay in touch. After sending the email, you may also contact your operation staff in TapTap to speed up the process.  

### **4\. How to change provider’s title? **  

Please send your request to [operation@taptap.com](mailto:operation@taptap.com) with scanned copy of your company’s Business License or other materials that could prove you are an official staff of the provider of this game.  

**Template**  
> **<u>Subject</u>**  
> Application to change provider title in TapTap - XXX (provider’s original title)  

> ---  

> Title and the link to the page of the provider to be changed:  
> New provider title:   
> Scanned copy of business license of other proof materials <Gray>(which can be uploaded as attachments)</Gray>:  
> Reason for change <Gray>(please be brief)</Gray>：  
> Contact of applicant:

 TapTap’s operation staff will contact you and process your request within 2 business days after receiving your email. Please stay in touch. After sending the email, you may also contact your operation staff in TapTap to speed up the process.  

### **5\. Do I have to start uploading games right after I passed the developer audit？ **  
No  
TapTap has no requirements for the time created for games, so developers may create games according to their own schedules. TapTap does recommend developers to upload games as early as possible to accumulate more pre-registrations.

The Friends service comes with two models:

- [Friend mode](/sdk/friends/mutual/)
- [Follow mode](/sdk/friends/follow/)

Depending on the requirements of your game, you can pick one of the two models for your game.
Keep in mind that:

- You can only choose one of the two models for your game, **but not both**.
- Once you have picked one model, **you cannot switch to the other one later**.

Your game can also obtain players’ connections [from third-party platforms](/sdk/friends/third-party/). To use this feature, please submit a ticket to us to enable it.

Here is a recommended path for you to learn how to use Friends in your game:

- Learn about [TDS Authentication](/sdk/authentication/features/), the built-in TDS account system, which the Friends service depends on. The “players” and “users” mentioned later in this guide all refer to `TDSUser`s.

- Follow this guide to learn about how to initialize the SDK.

- Pick a model for your game depending on your requirements and read the corresponding guide:

  - [Friend mode](/sdk/friends/mutual/)
  - [Follow mode](/sdk/friends/follow/)

## Initializing the SDK

With the initialization process mentioned in [Quickstart](/sdk/start/quickstart/#initialization) completed, proceed to the [Downloads](/tap-download) page and download the TapSDK, then add the `TapFriends` module:

<MultiLang>

<CodeBlock className="json">
  {`"dependencies":{
  ...
  "com.taptap.tds.friends": "https://github.com/TapTap/TapFriends-Unity.git#${sdkVersions.taptap.unity}",
}`}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock className="groovy">
  {`repositories{
    flatDir {
        dirs 'libs'
    }
}
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation (name:'TapFriend_${sdkVersions.taptap.android}', ext:'aar')
}`}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock className="objectivec">
  {`TapFriendResource.bundle
TapFriendSDK.framework
TapFriendUISDK.framework`}
</CodeBlock>

</MultiLang>

To use rich presence in your game, please first enable **Real-time synchronization of rich information interface data** on **Developer Center > Game Services > Cloud Services > Friends > Settings**,
then set the rick presence fields needed through the REST API for [configuring rich presence fields](#configuring-rich-presence-fields).

## Rich Presence REST API

Below are the REST API interfaces related to rich presence.
You can write your own scripts to perform administrative operations on the server side by interacting with these interfaces.

### Request Format

For POST and PUT requests, the request body must be in JSON, and the Content-Type of the HTTP Header should be `application/json`.

Requests are authenticated by the following key-value pairs in the HTTP Header:

| Key        | Value        | Meaning                                     | Source                                    |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `X-LC-Id`  | `{{appid}}`  | The `App Id` (`Client Id`) of your game     | Can be obtained from the Developer Center |
| `X-LC-Key` | `{{appkey}}` | The `App Key` (`Client Token`) of your game | Can be obtained from the Developer Center |

Using the management interface requires you to provide the `Master Key`: `X-LC-Key: {{masterkey}},master`.
`Master Key`, also called `Server Secret`, can be obtained from the Developer Center as well.

See [Credentials](/sdk/storage/guide/setup-dotnet#credentials) for more information.

### Base URL

The Base URL for REST API requests (the `{{host}}` in the curl examples) is the custom API domain of your app. You can update or find it on the Developer Center.
See [Domain](/sdk/storage/guide/setup-dotnet#domain) for more details.

### Retrieving Rich Presence Configurations

```sh
curl -X GET \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Session: {{sessionToken}}" \
  https://{{host}}/friend/v1/rich-presence/config
```

Response:

```json
{
  "clientId": "YOUR CLIENT ID",
  "enabled": 1,
  "richMsgEnabled": true,
  "onlineMsgEnabled": true,
  "webSocketUrl": "wss://XXX.ws.tds1.tapapis.cn/ws/leancloud/v1",
  "richPresenceFields": [
    {
      "key": "display",
      "type": "token"
    },
    {
      "key": "leadboard",
      "type": "token"
    },
    {
      "key": "inviteable",
      "type": "variable"
    },
    {
      "key": "score",
      "type": "variable"
    },
    {
      "key": "rank",
      "type": "variable"
    }
  ],
  "richPresenceMultiLang": [
    {
      "key": "display",
      "lang": "en_US",
      "content": {
        "#playing": "Playing",
        "#idle": "Idle",
        "#room": "Room",
        "#matching": "Matching"
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "display",
      "lang": "zh_CN",
      "content": {
        "#playing": "游戏中",
        "#idle": "在线",
        "#room": "准备中",
        "#matching": "组队中"
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "leadboard",
      "lang": "en_US",
      "content": {
        "#score": "%score% score",
        "#rank": "%rank% rank"
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "leadboard",
      "lang": "zh_CN",
      "content": {
        "#score": "%score% 分,排名为 %rank%",
        "#rank": "%rank% 名"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuring Rich Presence Fields

Rich presence fields can be set through the REST API. The names and types of each field needs to be provided.
This is a management interface, so the `Master Key` is required for authentication:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{masterkey}},master" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "enableRichMsg":true,
    "enableOnlineMsg":true,
    "richPresenceFields":[
        {"key":"display","type":"token"},
        {"key":"leadboard","type":"token"},
        {"key":"inviteable","type":"variable"},
        {"key":"score","type":"variable"},
        {"key":"rank","type":"variable"}
    ]
  }' \
  https://{{host}}/friend/v2/rich-presence/config/base-info
```

`enableRichMsg` and `enableOnlineMsg` are used to configure whether to enable notifications for rich presence updates and whether to enable notifications for friends’ online status updates. We recommend that you set both to be `true`.
Notice that **the version in the URL for this interface is `v2`**, which is different from other interfaces that use `v1`.

Response:

```json
{
  "appId": "YOUR CLIENT ID"
}
```

Response when there is an error:

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "error": "Missing request header"
}
```

### Configuring Multi-Language Contents

The following interface can be used to configure multi-language contents of rich presence fields.
This is a management interface, so the `Master Key` is required for authentication:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{masterkey}},master" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action":"save",
    "config":[
        {
            "key": "display",
            "lang": "en_US",
            "content": {
                "#playing": "Playing",
                "#idle": "Idle",
                "#room": "Room",
                "#matching": "Matching"
            }
        },
        {
            "key": "display",
            "lang": "zh_CN",
            "content": {
                "#playing": "游戏中",
                "#idle": "在线",
                "#room": "准备中",
                "#matching": "组队中"
            }
        },
        {
            "key": "leadboard",
            "lang": "en_US",
            "content": {
                "#score": "%score% score",
                "#rank": "%rank% rank best"
            }
        },
        {
            "key": "leadboard",
            "lang": "zh_CN",
            "content": {
                "#score": "%score% 分,竞技排名为 %rank%",
                "#rank": "%rank% 名"
            }
        }
    ]
  }'
  https://{{host}}/friend/v1/rich-presence/config/lang-info
```

The response will be the same as the one for [configuring rich presence fields](#configuring-rich-presence-fields).

### Retrieving Players’ Rich Presence Information

You can retrieve the rich presence information of multiple players at once (provide a comma-separated `objectId` list):

```sh
curl -X GET \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Session: {{sessionToken}}" \
  -G --data-urlencode 'ids={userObjectId,anotherUserObjectId}'
  https://{{host}}/friend/v1/rich-presence/users
```

Response

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "online": false,
      "richPresence": {
        "score": "15",
        "leadboard": "15 points; ranked 150th",
        "rank": "150"
      }
    },
    {
      "online": false,
      "richPresence": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

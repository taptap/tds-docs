## Introduction

TapTap Developer Services (TDS) offers the solution for you to quickly add friending-related features into your game.

## What We Offer

- **Easy-to-use APIs that improve your productivity**

  The Friends service provides features like adding, deleting, and searching for friends so you don’t have to build them yourself.

- **Real-time data tracking that allows you to perform refined operations**

  As a developer, you can utilize our tools to perform admin operations like looking up players’ connections and activity logs.

- **Access to TapTap’s ecosystem**

  Obtain the connections among TapTap users and boost your game’s experience with them.

## Basic Concepts

**Game friends**

Game friends are based on the built-in TDS account system. Interfaces applicable to them include adding, deleting, and searching for friends. There are two modes available for game friends: Follow mode and Friend mode.

- Follow mode

  Player A can follow Player B to become their follower. Player B now becomes a followee of Player A. If Player B then follows Player A, Player A and Player B will become mutual followers.

- Friend mode

  Player A can send a friend request to Player B. Once Player B accepts the request, Player A and Player B become friends.

You can choose either Follow mode or Friend mode for your game, but not both.

**TapTap friends**

For users logged in with TapTap, you can obtain the mutual followers of these users from your game.

:::tip
Both game friends and TapTap friends depend on the built-in TDS account system. Make sure to enable TDS Authentication before you use Friends in your game.

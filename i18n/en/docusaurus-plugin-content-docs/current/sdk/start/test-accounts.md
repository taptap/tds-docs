You can manage the tester list for TapTap login, Copyright Verification, and other related services. Users can join the testing of your game with TapTap Login before it passes the review and is officially released.  After your game is released on TapTap, you can make the login available for all users at ‘TapTap Login - Status’.

**Attention**

* **Make sure you already have the permission to manage the testers. The following roles have this permission by default: Super Administrator, Game Administrator, Publisher, and Developer.**
* **Make sure that your game’s configuration has been enabled.**

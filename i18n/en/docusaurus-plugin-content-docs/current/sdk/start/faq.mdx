## Miscellaneous

### Does TDS Cloud Services come with DDoS protection?

TDS provides 2 Gbps of protection bandwidth by default, which protects against small attacks at no additional cost to the developer.
For exclusive games, TDS provides high protection free of charge during the exclusive period. Developers simply need to communicate with TDS in advance about configuration details.
For other games, TDS can assist in accessing the IaaS provider's DDoS protection service at the developer's expense (IaaS providers charge for DDoS protection bandwidth). Please contact us for further details.


### Is there a limit to the number of accounts with real-name authentication for the same ID?

Currently, TapTap requires that a single ID  can only be used for real-name authentication on up to 5 TapTap accounts. There is no limit on real-name authentication for game accounts.


### How do I get the MD5 of an Android application?

#### 1. Using an app

If you only have the APK file of your application, you can use the following tool to get the MD5: [**GenSignatureMD5**](https://capacity-files.lcfile.com/vW65JxH2b2KwDS8JcbVUfiwLHSeHTlD5/tds_getsign.apk). To use the tool, sign and package the game application with an official signature certificate, and then install the APK package on the phone. Install the GenSignatureMD5 tool on the same phone, then open the tool and enter the name of the game package to get the signature MD5.

#### 2. Using Android Studio

**For JDK 10 or below**, after signing the application correctly, open a terminal in the jks signature file directory and enter the command:

```sh
keytool -list -v -keystore xxx.jks
```
You will see the signature file information in the command window, including the SHA1 and MD5 values. **Note that this approach does not work for versions below JDK 10**.

For versions above JDK 10, you can't get the MD5 using the above method, but you can use Android Studio's Gradle Tasks to check it, and the debug window will output the MD5 after double-clicking the signingReport in the figure below.

:::caution

Note that the MD5 value output from the signingReport debug window is separated by colons, so you will need to manually remove the colons when entering it into the Developer Center.
Example of a value to enter in the TapTap Developer Center:
> 
> Correct: 6EB4347CF9C098BE1C8D965D539C42E2
>
> Incorrect: 6E:B4:34:7C:F9:C0:98:BE:1C:8D:96:5D:53:9C:42:E2

:::

If there is no Gradle Tasks tab in the right Gradle panel, uncheck the options shown below in the settings and sync Gradle again to see the Gradle Tasks tab.

### What should I do if the versions of okhttp used by TapSDK and Bilibili SDK on Android have conflicts?

TapSDK now automatically includes the LeanCloud core SDK, and the LeanCloud SDK relies on the following base libraries:
- com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.7.2
- com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0
- io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxjava:2.2.19

Some developers have given us feedback that the Bilibili game SDK is provided as an aar with okhttp 3.9.0 (at least until version 5.4.0), which conflicts with the TapSDK dependencies and causes the program to start with the following error:
`Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: No static method get(Ljava/lang/String;)Lokhttp3/HttpUrl; in class Lokhttp3/HttpUrl; or its super classes (declaration of 'okhttp3.HttpUrl' appears in /data/app/`

Since the Bilibili game SDK fixes the okhttp version, solving this problem requires downgrading the okhttp, retrofit, and rxjava base libraries in TapSDK.
You can copy the following configuration to the `dependencies` section of the app's build.gradle:

<details>

<summary>Configuration of build.gradle</summary>

    // Note that the following code uses the latest version of the LeanCloud core SDK; if you are not using ${sdkVersions.leancloud.java}, please replace the version codes accordingly

## TapTap Login

### TapTap Login throws `signature not match` exception
This exception is thrown if you have integrated TapTap Login but have not configured a signature in the Developer Center backend or have configured it incorrectly. Some developers may not be able to see the exception, so you can verify it this way: If you uninstall the TapTap client and test the login function, the WebView authorization window will pop up, but the device with the TapTap client installed will not be able to pull up the client for authorization, which is basically caused by incorrectly configuring the signature. Please refer to [the documentation](/sdk/start/quickstart/#configure-signature-certificate) to complete the configuration.

### TapTap Login throws `state not equal` exception
Check if the system time of the current device is already synchronized with the network and check if the TapTap client version of the current device is too low.

### TapTap Login throws `java.lang.NoSuchFieldException: CACHE_ELSE_NETWORK` exception
Since the Android project has enabled obfuscation, and the TapSDK has already done the obfuscation, you need to skip the TapSDK obfuscation. Please see [Android Code Obfuscation](/sdk/start/quickstart/#android-code-obfuscation). For native Android, resource obfuscation is not currently supported. If the project has resource obfuscation enabled, please disable it by setting `shrinkResources false`.

### TapTap Login throws `{"code":36869,"error_description":"Unauthorized."}` exception
Check if the Client ID, Client Token, and ServerURL parameters for TapSDK initialization are set incorrectly. Also, please **use the HTTPS protocol** for the ServerURL. See the documentation for **[domain](/sdk/start/get-ready/#domains)**.

### When using the Basic TapTap User Verification, I see the following exception:
```
Assembly 'Assets/TapTap/Common/Plugins/TapTap.Common.dll' will not be loaded due to errors:
Unable to resolve reference 'LC.Newtonsoft.Json'. Is the assembly missing or incompatible with the current platform?
```
The error is caused by using TapSDK Unity v3.7.1 and above without adding the `com.leancloud.storage` module to the project's `Packages/manifest.json` file. See [documentation](/sdk/taptap-login/guide/tap-login/#getting-the-sdk).




### The player sees this message when trying to log in: this app is not allowed for this domain

1. Check whether the TapTap login service is enabled in the application configuration in the developer console;
2. Ensure that the ClientId, ClientToken, and ServerUrl (must start with https://) in the project initialization code are consistent with those in the developer console.

### Can developers get a player's mobile phone number after a player logs in through TapTap?

No. Mobile phone numbers are private information of the players. Developers are not allowed to obtain the mobile phone numbers of logged-in players at this time.

## Anti-addiction

### Is it required for developers (including organizations) to implement anti-addiction measures

According to the Notice of Further Strict Management and Effective Prevention of Minors' Addiction to Online Games issued by China's National Press and Publication Administration [link](https://www.nppa.gov.cn/xxfb/tzgs/202108/t20210830_666285.html), all game publishing and operating companies must implement real-name authentication and anti-addiction policies within their games. Games without a license can use TDS's [Real-name Authentication and Anti-addiction](/sdk/anti-addiction/features/) system.

### What is the relationship between anti-addiction and login

Starting from version 3.7.1, Quick Verification does not rely on the TapTap Login SDK, so there is **no** strong association between anti-addiction and login. However, after using TapTap login, you can use [Quick Verification](/sdk/anti-addiction/features/#taptap-quick-verification) for anti-addiction. With the player's consent, they can quickly complete the in-game authentication process using their real-name information verified by TapTap.
**Otherwise**, you can use our provided [Real-name Authentication](/sdk/anti-addiction/features/#real-name-verification-and-anti-addiction). TDS has connected to the Ministry of Publicity's online game anti-addiction and real-name authentication system and reports information under the developer's name, meeting regulatory requirements.

### After logging out an account that has completed the real-name verification and restarting the game, the real-name verification process is skipped.

Starting from version 3.7.1, quick authentication does not rely on TapTap Login SDK, so there is **no** strong association between anti-addiction and login. Therefore, you need to log out of the current account before switching accounts. When a player logs in for the first time, the SDK will show a real-name verification popup for players to authorize the game to access their TapTap real-name information or input their identity information. After successful authentication, subsequent calls to the authentication interface with the same userIdentifier (unique identifier) will directly receive the result of the first-time authentication without triggering a popup.
Thus, a user's unique identifier should be ensured for uniqueness.

Please complete the following setup process before you start using TapTap Developer Services (TDS).

## Create an Application

Before integrating TDS into your game, please first create an application. See [Store Guide](/store/) for more details.

## Turn On Game Services

Go to **TapTap Developer Center > Your Game > Game Services > Configuration** and tap “Turn on Now” to obtain the basic info of your app.

### Basic Info

`Client ID` is the unique identifier for an app package in the TapTap Developer Center. TapTap uses the `Client ID` to identify applications. Since each app has only one `Client ID`, if you need to have a test server besides an official server for the same app, you must create two different apps and activate their configurations separately.

### Applicable Region

<Conditional region="cn">

TapTap has two service areas: one for Mainland China and one for other countries and regions. Each service area has its own account system and each application you create can only work for one of the two service areas.

<Conditional region="global">

The service is applicable for countries and regions outside of Mainland China.

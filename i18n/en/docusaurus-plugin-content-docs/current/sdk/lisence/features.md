## Price Settings

TapTap's copyright verification service must be configured with the paid gameâ€™s price settings. TapTap helps the developers to manage their paid games and offers multiple payment methods for the players. You can make your game a paid game in the Price Settings at <Conditional region='cn'>[TapTap Developer Center](https://developer.taptap.com/)</Conditional><Conditional region='global'>[TapTap Developer Center](https://developer.taptap.io/)</Conditional> and set up the price.  To create a sale event, you can turn on the sales feature. You will be able to set up the start and end date, as well as the sale price.

## Integrate SDK

After a game integrates the copyright verification SDK, it will make a verification query on purchase results when a user launches the game.  The user will be able to access the game if it has been purchased normally.   Otherwise, a message will remind the player to purchase the game first. Refer to [Developer Guide](/sdk/lisence/guide/) for details about the integration.

## Overview

Billboard allows developers to publish and edit billboard contents on the Developer Center, which players can see when they open the game.

## Highlights

- Reduced costs: We’ll give you everything you need to create a billboard in your game so you don’t have to build it yourself.
- Easy-to-use tools: With the tools we provide, you can easily publish contents to the billboard in your game.
- Customizable configurations: You can upload custom themes and configure properties for content distribution without writing a single line of code.
- Outstanding compatibility: We offer user interfaces built with WebView, which supports layouts containing images and texts better compared to those built with game engines.
- Convenience to maintain: The Billboard service doesn’t depend on other services and you don’t have to update the SDK in order to update the contents of the billboard in your game.

## Getting Started

- For an account to have access to the Billboard service, please go to *Manage Permissions* and give this account the *Game Administrator* permission.
- To make the Billboard services accessible to the players, a custom domain has to be added to the game.
- Follow **[Billboard Design Guideline](/design/design-billboard/)** to design the assets needed for the billboard in the game.
- The minimum TapSDK version required to use Billboard is 3.12.0 for iOS and Android and 3.12.1 for Unity.

**Regarding Icons for different types of announcement**

You can use different icons for different types of announcements to get these announcements better distinguished. We offer 6 icons that you can use directly for different types, though it is not a requirement for you to pick an icon for each type.

### Create Announcements

When you create an announcement, you need to provide its content as well as settings. You will be able to **release the announcement immediately** or **save it as a draft**. Released announcements cannot be converted to drafts anymore, but you will be able to **hide** or **release (unhide)** a released announcement.

For each announcement you create, you need to provide a Long Title, a Short Title, and its Content. You can set up multiple languages for the announcement.

![](/img/billboard/release_billboard_content.png)

You will be configuring *Display as*, *Type*, *Landing on*, *Distribution*, and *Date Settings* when you create an announcement.

- Display as: You can associate the content of the announcement to a template. For now, you can only pick *Navigation Bar*.
- Type: You can choose from *Update*, *Maintenance*, *New Arrival*, *Event*, *Gameplay*, *Test*, and *Sever Closing*.
- Landing on: You can choose from *Content of Announcement*, *Redirection*, and *In-Game Scene*.
- Distribution: You can choose either to release the announcement to **everyone** or to **specify a number of distributions**. You can pick multiple options for each distribution.
- Date Settings: You can set a schedule for the announcement **to be released** and **to be hidden**.

:::tip

1. You can specify a callback URL for jumping from the announcement back to the game.

2. You can still edit the distributions of an announcement after you release it.

3. A hidden announcement will be released again when you edit and save it.

### Sort Announcements

You can give a number to each announcement to **control the order** of all the announcements of your game. Announcements with larger numbers will be displayed at the beginning of the list.

You will be able to **filter announcements** according to **No.**, **Status**, **Display as**, **Region**, **Platform**, **Long Title**, and **Release Date**.

![](/img/billboard/billboard_list.png)

### Duplicate Announcements

You will be able to **duplicate** an announcement to the current game or a different game and use it as a draft. The properties of an announcement cannot be duplicated. An announcement duplicated from another one will have unlimited properties by default.

### Display of Announcements

#### Navigation Bar

When there is at least one unread message under the *Announcements* tab or the *Events* tab, a badge will be displayed. The badge will disappear when all the messages are read.

When using Navigation Bar, the most recent 20 announcements will be displayed.

The content of an announcement can contain highlighted text, images, videos, and links. In landscape mode, the content of the first announcement will be automatically displayed. In portrait mode, only the announcement list will be displayed. The user will be able to go back to the list after they open an announcement.

A link can either be opened in an external browser or take the user to a module within the game. It may also take the player to the content of an announcement.

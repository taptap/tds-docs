## Payment cycle and reporting 

TapTap's payment cycle is usually 45 days after the end of the natural month. For example, the revenue for the natural month of January (January 1 - January 31) will enter the accounting stage after January 31, and the payment will be completed within 45 days, that is, March 15 is TapTap's latest payment date. Please note that your bank may take a few days to credit the relevant amount to your account. 

After entering the accounting stage, you can see the reports to be settled in [Finance and Management]-[Reconciliation and Settlement], including data such as product sales amount, user refund amount, fee deduction, and actual profit amount within the current period. You must carefully verify the report and confirm the final amount with TapTap within 7 working days.

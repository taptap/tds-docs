## Installing SDK

There are several ways for you to install our SDK and the most convenient one is to use a package manager.

### Installing with Package Manager

The easiest way to integrate our SDK into your project is to use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org).

Make sure you already have the latest version of `pod` on your computer. If not, please check out the [INSTALL](https://cocoapods.org) section on CocoaPods’ website.

Then, run the following command under the root directory of your project to generate the `Podfile`:

```sh
$ pod init
```

Following the [GET STARTED](https://cocoapods.org) section on CocoaPods’ website, add the following pod dependency into the `target` of the `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'LeanCloudObjc'   # A module for all the services
```

`LeanCloudObjc` contains multiple Subspecs. You can choose to only add the ones you need:

```ruby
pod 'LeanCloudObjc/Foundation'    # Basic services including Data Storage, SMS, and Cloud Engine
pod 'LeanCloudObjc/Realtime'      # Instant Messaging and LiveQuery
```

The last step is to run the following command to integrate the latest SDK:

```sh
$ pod update
```

You can also run:

```sh
$ pod install --repo-update
```

After installing the SDK, you can open your project with `<PROJECT_NAME>.xcworkspace` under the root directory of your project.

### Installing Manually

First of all, [download](https://releases.leanapp.cn/#/leancloud/objc-sdk/releases) the latest source code of the SDK.

Then drag and drop the `AVOS`/`AVOS.xcodeproj` project file into the project as a subproject:

![AVOS.xcodeproj will appear under the root directory of the project.](/img/quick_start/ios/subproject.png)

Now connect the dependencies by going to **xcodeproj > target > general > frameworks** and adding the following content:

![LeanCloudObjc.framework](/img/quick_start/ios/link-binary.png)

That’s it. You are now ready to use our SDK in your project.

## Initializing Your Project

Import the basic modules into `AppDelegate`:

```objc
#import <LeanCloudObjc/Foundation.h>
```

Then configure the `App ID`, `App Key`, and the server URL under the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method:

```objc
[LCApplication setApplicationId:@"your-client-id"
                      clientKey:@"your-client-token"
                serverURLString:@"https://your_server_url"];
```

Before using the APIs provided by the SDK, make sure you have initialized your application with the App ID, App Key, and server URL.

### Credentials

<AppConfig />

## Domain

<DomainBinding />

## Enabling Debug Logs

You can easily trace the problems in your project by turning debug logs on during the development phase. Once enabled, details of every request made by the SDK along with errors will be output to your IDE, your browser console, or your Cloud Engine instances’ logs.

```objc
// Run before initializing the Application
[LCApplication setAllLogsEnabled:true];
```

:::caution
Make sure debug logs are turned off before your app is published. Failure to do so may lead to the exposure of sensitive data.
:::

## Verifying

First of all, make sure you are able to connect to the server from your computer. You can test it by running the following command:

```sh
curl "https://{{host}}/1.1/date"
```

`{{host}}` is the custom API domain.

If everything goes well, it will return the current date:

```json
{ "__type": "Date", "iso": "2020-10-12T06:46:56.000Z" }
```

Now let’s try saving an object to the cloud. Add the following code into the `viewDidLoad` method or any other method that will be called when the app starts:

```objc
LCObject *testObject = [LCObject objectWithClassName:@"TestObject"];
[testObject setObject:@"Hello world!" forKey:@"words"];
[testObject save];
```

Hit `Run` to start debugging. This can be done in either a host or a virtual machine.

Then go to **Developer Center > Your game > Game Services > Cloud Services > Data Storage > Data > `TestObject`**. If you see a row with its `words` column being `Hello world!`, it means that you have correctly installed the SDK.

See [Debugging](#Debugging) if you’re not seeing the content.

## Debugging

This guide is written for the latest version of our SDK. If you encounter any errors, please first make sure you have the latest version installed.

### `401 Unauthorized`

If you get a `401` error or see the following content in network logs:

```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "error": "Unauthorized."
}
```

It means that the App ID or App Key might be incorrect or don’t match. If you have multiple apps, you might have used the App ID of one app with the App Key of another one, which will lead to such an error.

### The Client Cannot Access the Internet

Make sure you have granted the required permissions to your mobile app.

This document helps you get up to speed on how to create a Client Engine project, a simple two-player rock-paper-scissors game that relies on the Multiplayers JavaScript SDK for its logic.

In this document we will first learn how to start the project locally, try it out briefly, and then deploy the project to the cloud. After that, we will introduce the detailed game logic and how to develop our own game in [Developer Guide](/sdk/multiplayer/client-engine/guide-node/).

### Start the project

### Install command line tools

Please check the documentation of the command line tool **[Installation section](/sdk/engine/cli/#installation)** to install the command line tool and execute the command **[Login](/sdk/engine/cli/#login-account)** to log in.

### Create a project

Get the sample project from Github, please use this project as the base of your project:

```js
git clone https://github.com/leancloud/client-engine-nodejs-getting-started
cd client-engine-nodejs-getting-started
```

Add the application App ID and other information to the project:

```sh
lean switch
```

In the first step of selecting Apps, select the LeanCloud app that corresponds to your game. In the second step, when selecting the Cloud Engine group, you must select the `_client-engine` group, for which LeanCloud provides optimised maintenance and support specifically for the Client Engine, as shown here:

### Running locally

First, install the necessary dependencies in the current project directory, and execute the following command line:

```sh
npm install
```

If the data storage service will also be used, execute the following command line:

```sh
npm install leancloud-storage
```

Turn on debug logging when starting the application:

```sh
DEBUG=ClientEngine*,RPS*,Play lean up
```

If you don't need the debug log, you can start it directly with the following command:

```sh
lean up
```

After startup, open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to check if the project started properly.

### Visit the site

#### Feel the game

After the server-side project is started, if you want to experience the demo game, you need to open two additional [Client Sample Demo](https://client-engine-app.leanapp.cn/) pages at the same time, and do the following configurations in these two pages:

Click Configs, APP_ID , APP_KEY and PLAY_SERVER fill in the App ID, App Key and server address of the previously selected application:

```sh
# If your browser is already logged into LeanCloud, please select the relevant app below, copy and paste the relevant information into Configs:
 APP_ID: "your-app-id"
 APP_KEY: "your-app-key"
```

Next, enter `http://localhost:3000` in Client Engine Server. As shown in the picture:

Once the information is filled in, click `Login to Play` to start the game.

#### Client Code

If you want to see the detailed client code, you can visit [Client Sample Code](https://github.com/leancloud/client-engine-demo-webapp) on github.

## Deploying to the Cloud

Deploy to a prepared environment and run it in the root directory:

```sh
lean deploy --staging
```

Log in to the LeanCloud console in a browser, bind the [cloud engine domain name](/sdk/domain/guide/#cloud-engine-domain-name) (custom domains starting with `stg-` are automatically bound to the ready environment), and then visit the appropriate URL to see the text of the Client Engine server being run.

For other detailed deployment methods, please refer to [Deployment] (/sdk/engine/cli/#deployment) in the command line tools documentation.

## Your first Client Engine mini-game

Next, please see the documentation [Your First Client Engine Game](/sdk/multiplayer/client-engine/first-game-node/) for a step-by-step guide on how to develop a rock-paper-scissors game based on this initial project.

This article describes how to perform statistical analysis of push effectiveness in TapDB.

## Data Types

### Event Types

There are two types of events related to push message effectiveness statistics in TapDB, which are automatically created when the push service is enabled, successfully integrated, and a delivery event is reported:

1. Push Notification Delivered: This event is used to indicate that the push message has been successfully received by the user's device. Its display name is "Push Notification Delivered" and its event name is `push_notification_received`.

2. Push Notification Clicked: This event is used to indicate that the user clicked on the push notification. "Push Notification Clicked" is its display name, and its event name is `push_notification_clicked`.

You can view the details of the above two events in TapDB Pro Console's **Configuration > Event Management**.

### Attribute Types

1. Event Attribute Types

    There are a number of event attribute types in TapDB that are related to push message effect statistics, including:

    The following event attribute types are automatically created when an event is reported:

    1. Push Delivery Time: Indicates the time at which a push delivery event occurred; the property name is `push_received_at`.

    2. Push Click Time: Indicates the time at which a push click event occurred; the property name is `push_clicked_at`.

    3. The installationId of the push service: As the name implies, this is the installationId of the device record in the push service; the property name is `push_installation_id`.

    4. Push Notification ID: Indicates the notificationId when the push is sent using the push service; the property name is `push_notification_id`.

    5. Third-party vendor type: Indicates that the Android device is using a third-party platform, such as Huawei, Xiaomi, etc. Its value is the lowercase form of the vendor field in the push device record. The property name is `push_vendor`.

    The default event attribute types pre-populated in TapDB are:

    1. Device OS: The device's operating system, which can be Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, and other values; the property name is "os".

    You can view the details of the above event attributes in TapDB Pro Console's **Configuration > Event Attribute Management**.

2. User Attribute Types

    The default user attribute types in TapDB are:

    1. Device ID: When the SDK is initialized, it generates a unique ID for the device, which we call the device ID. The attribute name is `device_id`, and note that its display name is "Device ID on activation".

    You can check the details of the above event attributes in TapDB Pro Console's **Configuration > Event Attribute Management**.

3. Related Documentation

    For the default properties, you can refer to the corresponding descriptions in [Data Specification](https://www.tapdb.com/docs/sdk/数据规范).

## Event Analysis

You can query push effect statistics via TapDB Pro Console's **Analysis > Event Analysis**. Simple examples include:

1. In **Report Settings**, click "Select Metrics" and select a metric from the pop-up window, such as "Push Notification Delivery", then click "Select Dimension" and select or add a dimension from the pop-up window, such as "Push Third Party Vendor Type".

2. Add filter conditions as appropriate. For example, click "Global Filter" and select "Push Notification ID" to select a specific push notification by its ID. Please do not select attributes that are not related to push effect statistics or you may not get the query result.

3. Select a time range and click Query to obtain data and charts. There are several ways to view the chart. You can choose according to your needs.

## Products
TapTap Connect (hereafter referred to as the Floating Window) is a tool that connects TapTap, games and players. Once a developer has enabled this feature, players who have successfully signed in to their TapTap accounts can browse game news, rate games, share game download links, and more in the Floating Window to help games improve retention and attract new users.

## Player Interaction Flow

- After logging into the game with TapTap, the player will see a Floating Window portal, which is semi-hidden by default and supports drag-and-drop and hovering.
- Clicking on the portal will open the Floating Window panel, which displays the player's TapTap account information (avatar, nickname and ID), and also allows the player to open inline news, share the game, and jump to the TapTap game details page to rate the game from within the Floating Window. (The rating feature is only supported by the Android system.)
- Players who click on the blank space outside the Floating Window panel will close the Floating Window and the lobby will automatically return to a semi-hidden state after 3 seconds.

## Functional Advantages

TapTap community content, rating sharing and other features are integrated so that players do not have to leave the game to perform related operations.

- Firstly, it can help the game to increase retention and attract new users;

- Secondly, it reduces the amount of access development for developers. After accessing the Floating Window, there is no need to separately access inline dynamics, open the comment area, share and other features.

## Products
TapTap Connect (hereafter referred to as the Floating Window) is a tool that connects TapTap, games and players. Once a developer has enabled this feature, players who have successfully logged in their TapTap accounts can browse game updates, rate games and share game download links in the Floating Window to help improve retention and bring in new users.

## Player Interaction Flow

- After logging into the game with TapTap, a Floating Window portal will appear, which is semi-hidden by default and supports drag and drop as well as hovering.
- Clicking on the portal will open the Floating Window panel, which displays the player's TapTap account information (avatar, nickname and ID), and also allows the player to open embedded updates, share games, and jump to the TapTap game page to rate the game from within the Floating Window. (The rating feature is only supported by the Android system.)
- Players who click on the blank space outside the Floating Window panel will close the Floating Window and the portal will automatically return to a semi-hidden state after 3 seconds.

## Functional Advantages

TapTap community content, review sharing and other capabilities are integrated so that players can perform related operations without leaving the game.

- Firstly, it can help the game increase retention and bring in new users;

- Secondly, it reduces the amount of access development for developers. After accessing the Floating Window, there is no need to separately access embedded dynamics, open the comment area, share and other features.

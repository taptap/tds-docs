## Functions

  
- The Update Evocation Service is mainly applied to the update scenario of game packs sold in TapTap's domestic store and is currently only supported on Android.
- To use the Update Wake feature, you need to access the TapSDK, the developer will call the TapSDK update interface after determining that the game needs a major update, then it will wake up the TapTap client and direct the user to go to TapTap to complete the update.

## Access Advantages
- **Save development and traffic costs: After the game accesses the update evocation function, there is no need to develop the APK package update process itself, and at the same time, it can also save the traffic cost required to download the new version.
- **Help players standardise the game update process and increase game popularity**: The TapSDK provides players with a standardised update process that is consistent with the update process experience on Apple's App Store. At the same time, the game update download heat is one of the factors affecting the TapTap Hot List, users go to TapTap update, at the node of the package of strong more will have the opportunity to be exposed in the Hot List, to get more traffic exposure, to help the game to attract new and old users of new and returning.

## Access Requirements
  
- The game must maintain the unity of the whole network update method, the platform will not interfere with the game's own hot update operation, ** the game only needs to request the SDK to update the interface when the package is changed to invoke the TapTap update **.

- Developers need to ensure that **the package of the game in the TapTap shop is the latest version**, otherwise users will open TapTap and find that the shop version is lower, which will affect the user experience.

- For games that are already on the store, developers must ensure that the package name in the **Update Profile version matches the package name of the game already on the store**, otherwise players may fail to update due to the inconsistency in the package name.

-  For new games, developers are required to upload a shop profile version with the APK package** (used by the platform to obtain the game's package name, which should match the package name of the subsequent update)** to TapTap, and if the APK package is not yet available to the public, the release status can be set to "Please wait" or "Reservation".


## Game Access Recommendations 
**The UI shown is for reference only and is not provided by TapSDK.**

1. **Package change scenario**: Players must update to the latest package before they can play the game.
- When the game determines that the current package needs to be updated, it will open a pop-up window (as shown below) after the APP starts or the user logs in successfully, informing the player that the current version is too low, and when the user clicks on the "Update" button, it will directly call the TapSDK to update the interface. When the user clicks the "Update" button, the TapSDK update interface will be called directly. When the user clicks the "Cancel" button, the game will be closed or the player will be prompted that "the game can't be played if you don't update to the latest version".

2. **Ordinary Update Scenario**: The game supports hot update, or players can play the game without updating to the latest package.
- The platform does not require developers to request TapSDK to update the interface in ordinary update scenarios to force players to update and guide them, and if developers need players to update, they can do so in other scenarios such as announcements and other weak guidance reminders.


## Description of update evocation process
 
After the game calls the TapSDK update interface, TapSDK will check if the TapTap client is installed on the current device to enter a different update process.


### Player has installed TapTap Client

- TapSDK will directly evoke the TapTap client and jump to the game update page to guide users to complete the update. When the TapTap client is evoked, the device may have a prompt to open a third-party APP (the style of the prompt may vary from device to device, the picture below is only for reference), the user needs to agree to open TapTap, and then follow the guidance of the page to complete the game update.

### Player does not have the TapTap client installed

- If TapSDK checks that the TapTap client is not currently installed on the device, it will first ask the user "Do you need to use TapTap to update" (see the image below, provided by TapSDK).

- Once the user confirms the update, the TapTap client will begin to download directly, and when it finishes downloading, it will automatically ask the device to install it, and the user will be guided by the device to complete the installation (see below).

- After the TapTap client has been downloaded and installed successfully, it will continue to jump to the TapTap update game page, some Android devices will guide the user to go back to the game, and the SDK will also prompt the user to "open TapTap to update" (see the picture below, the pop-up window is provided by TapSDK). After opening TapTap, users will be guided by the page to complete the game update.

- For the above process, if the user chooses to close the pop-up window or cancellation and other interruptions to update the game, TapSDK will provide relevant callback interfaces to facilitate developers to take over the user's subsequent actions. For example, when the user cancels "use TapTap to update", TapSDK will tell the user that the game update failed.

## Best Practice

### 香肠派对 
Players will be reminded of the update requirement through in-game announcements, but will also be rewarded after the update to encourage them to update.

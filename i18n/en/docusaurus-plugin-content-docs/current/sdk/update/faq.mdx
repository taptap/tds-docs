### A pop-up window says, "Request failed. Please try again."
You can refer to [Pre-Integration Preparation](/sdk/update/guide/#pre-integration-preparation) to check whether the APK has been submitted and approved, and whether the release settings are set to go live immediately.


### Upgrade process for updating to a new version from a version prior to v3.23.0
Remove the original `updateGame` related interface code and re-access it as [sdk-acquisition](/sdk/update/guide/#sdk-acquisition).


### What Android dependencies are added by a Unity wake update
Firstly, the Unity wakeup update will only take effect on the **Android** platform, and secondly the new dependencies added by the wakeup update will be automatically added to the [Unity Gradle Template](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/gradle-templates.html) during the packaging process. You can see it in `WakeUpDateModule/Mobile/Editor/TapTapUpdateDependencies.xml`, specifically 3 dependencies will be added:
1. com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.12.1
2. androidx.core:core:1.6.0
3. com.google.android.flexbox:flexbox:3.0.0

## How can I access this feature for standalone games without a server?

Standalone games do not need to access the Update Recall feature at this time.

## Does the update recall function support iOS version?

Due to Apple's policy, the TapTap client on iOS platforms cannot provide game update function, and the ability to recall updates is only supported on Android platforms.

## Does the update recall feature only work on forced update versions of the game?

Games must use the "Update Evocation" service in forced update scenarios. **When a game requires a package update, request the SDK to update the interface and evoke TapTap to update it**, and the platform will not interfere with the game's own hot update operation. If the game is in a non-forced update scenario, and also wants the user to update it, you can try to remind the user of the update in the announcements and other scenarios.

## How to test the update wake-up function after accessing it?

It is recommended to accept the effect of access in the test environment, the specific testing process is as follows:

1. Simulate the actual update scene of the game, and the version code of the package to be tested should be lower than the latest version of the game set on the server. 2;
2. when opening the test package with a lower version number, the game needs to obtain the version number on the server and compare it with the version number of the current test package. 3. judge the version number of the current test package;
3. If the version number of the current test package is lower, the interface of the update wake-up function can be called up successfully;
4. Functional verification is completed.

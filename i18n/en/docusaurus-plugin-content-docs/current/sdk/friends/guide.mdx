The Friends service comes with two models:

- [Friend Mode](/sdk/friends/mutual/)
- [Follow Mode](/sdk/friends/follow/)

Depending on the requirements of your game, you can pick one of the two models for your game.
Keep in mind that:

- You can only choose one of the two models for your game, **but not both**.
- Once you have picked one model, **you cannot switch to the other one later**.

Your game can also obtain players’ connections [from third-party platforms](/sdk/friends/third-party/). To use this feature, please submit a ticket to us to enable it.

Here is a recommended path for you to learn how to use Friends in your game:

- Learn about [TDS Authentication](/sdk/authentication/features/), the built-in TDS account system, which the Friends service depends on. The “players” and “users” mentioned later in this guide all refer to `TDSUser`s.

- Follow this guide to learn about how to initialize the SDK.

- Pick a model for your game depending on your requirements and read the corresponding guide:

  - [Friend Mode](/sdk/friends/mutual/)
  - [Follow Mode](/sdk/friends/follow/)

## Initializing the SDK

With the initialization process mentioned in [Quickstart](/sdk/start/quickstart/#initialization) completed, proceed to the [Downloads](/tap-download) page and download the TapSDK, then add the `TapFriends` module:

<MultiLang>

<CodeBlock className="json">
  {`"dependencies":{
  ...
  "com.taptap.tds.friends": "https://github.com/TapTap/TapFriends-Unity.git#${sdkVersions.taptap.unity}",
}`}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock className="groovy">
  {`repositories{
    flatDir {
        dirs 'libs'
    }
}
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation (name:'TapFriend_${sdkVersions.taptap.android}', ext:'aar')
}`}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock className="objectivec">
  {`TapFriendResource.bundle
TapFriendSDK.framework
TapFriendUISDK.framework`}
</CodeBlock>

</MultiLang>

To use rich presence in your game, please first enable **Real-time synchronization of rich information interface data** on **Developer Center > Game Services > Cloud Services > Friends > Settings**,
then set the rick presence fields needed through the REST API for [configuring rich presence fields](#configuring-rich-presence-fields).

## Rich Presence REST API

Below are the REST API interfaces related to rich presence.
You can write your own scripts to perform administrative operations by interacting with these interfaces.

### Request Format

For POST and PUT requests, the request body must be in JSON, and the Content-Type of the HTTP Header should be `application/json`.

Requests are authenticated by the following key-value pairs in the HTTP Header:

| Key        | Value        | Meaning                                     | Source                                    |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `X-LC-Id`  | `{{appid}}`  | The `App Id` (`Client Id`) of your game     | Can be obtained from the Developer Center |
| `X-LC-Key` | `{{appkey}}` | The `App Key` (`Client Token`) of your game | Can be obtained from the Developer Center |

Using the management interface requires you to provide the `Master Key`: `X-LC-Key: {{masterkey}},master`.
`Master Key`, also called `Server Secret`, can be obtained from the Developer Center as well.

See [Credentials](/sdk/storage/guide/setup-dotnet#credentials) for more information.

### Base URL

The Base URL for REST API requests (the `{{host}}` in the curl examples) is the custom API domain of your app. You can update or find it on the Developer Center.
See [Domain](/sdk/storage/guide/setup-dotnet#domain) for more details.

### Retrieving Rich Presence Configurations

```sh
curl -X GET \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Session: {{sessionToken}}" \
  https://{{host}}/friend/v1/rich-presence/config
```

Response:

```json
{
  "clientId": "YOUR CLIENT ID",
  "enabled": 1,
  "richMsgEnabled": true,
  "onlineMsgEnabled": true,
  "webSocketUrl": "wss://XXX.ws.tds1.tapapis.cn/ws/leancloud/v1",
  "richPresenceFields": [
    {
      "key": "display",
      "type": "token"
    },
    {
      "key": "leadboard",
      "type": "token"
    },
    {
      "key": "inviteable",
      "type": "variable"
    },
    {
      "key": "score",
      "type": "variable"
    },
    {
      "key": "rank",
      "type": "variable"
    }
  ],
  "richPresenceMultiLang": [
    {
      "key": "display",
      "lang": "en_US",
      "content": {
        "#playing": "Playing",
        "#idle": "Idle",
        "#room": "Room",
        "#matching": "Matching"
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "display",
      "lang": "zh_CN",
      "content": {
        "#playing": "游戏中",
        "#idle": "在线",
        "#room": "准备中",
        "#matching": "组队中"
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "leadboard",
      "lang": "en_US",
      "content": {
        "#score": "%score% score",
        "#rank": "%rank% rank"
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "leadboard",
      "lang": "zh_CN",
      "content": {
        "#score": "%score% 分,排名为 %rank%",
        "#rank": "%rank% 名"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuring Rich Presence Fields

Rich presence fields can be set through the REST API. The names and types of each field needs to be provided.
This is a management interface, so the `Master Key` is required for authentication:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{masterkey}},master" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "enableRichMsg":true,
    "enableOnlineMsg":true,
    "richPresenceFields":[
        {"key":"display","type":"token"},
        {"key":"leadboard","type":"token"},
        {"key":"inviteable","type":"variable"},
        {"key":"score","type":"variable"},
        {"key":"rank","type":"variable"}
    ]
  }' \
  https://{{host}}/friend/v2/rich-presence/config/base-info
```

`enableRichMsg` and `enableOnlineMsg` are used to configure whether to enable notifications for rich presence updates and whether to enable notifications for friends’ online status updates. We recommend that you set both to be `true`.
Notice that **the version in the URL for this interface is `v2`**, which is different from other interfaces that use `v1`.

Response:

```json
{
  "appId": "YOUR CLIENT ID"
}
```

Response when there is an error:

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "error": "Missing request header"
}
```

### Configuring Multi-Language Contents

The following interface can be used to configure multi-language contents of rich presence fields.
This is a management interface, so the `Master Key` is required for authentication:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{masterkey}},master" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action":"save",
    "config":[
        {
            "key": "display",
            "lang": "en_US",
            "content": {
                "#playing": "Playing",
                "#idle": "Idle",
                "#room": "Room",
                "#matching": "Matching"
            }
        },
        {
            "key": "display",
            "lang": "zh_CN",
            "content": {
                "#playing": "游戏中",
                "#idle": "在线",
                "#room": "准备中",
                "#matching": "组队中"
            }
        },
        {
            "key": "leadboard",
            "lang": "en_US",
            "content": {
                "#score": "%score% score",
                "#rank": "%rank% rank best"
            }
        },
        {
            "key": "leadboard",
            "lang": "zh_CN",
            "content": {
                "#score": "%score% 分,竞技排名为 %rank%",
                "#rank": "%rank% 名"
            }
        }
    ]
  }'
  https://{{host}}/friend/v1/rich-presence/config/lang-info
```

The response will be the same as the one for [configuring rich presence fields](#configuring-rich-presence-fields).

### Retrieving Players’ Rich Presence Information

You can retrieve the rich presence information of multiple players at once (provide a comma-separated `objectId` list):

```sh
curl -X GET \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Session: {{sessionToken}}" \
  --data-urlencode 'ids={userObjectId,anotherUserObjectId}'
  https://{{host}}/friend/v1/rich-presence/users
```

Response

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "online": false,
      "richPresence": {
        "score": "15",
        "leadboard": "15 points; ranked 150th",
        "rank": "150"
      }
    },
    {
      "online": false,
      "richPresence": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

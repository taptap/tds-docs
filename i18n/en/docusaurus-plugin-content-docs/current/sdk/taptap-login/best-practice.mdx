## Login Process

Conversion rate increases when players have a streamlined login process. Use the simplest method that retains all necessary steps, so players can quickly enter the game. As shown below:

### Login Interface

Provide players with a TapTap Login button designed according to [Login Design Guide](/design/). Refer to [Feature Summary](/sdk/taptap-login/features/)Â for information on displaying single/multiple login methods.

### Using Players' Public Info

When players create characters in-game, the system can utilize authorized public info upon logging into the game, such as the player's TapTap avatar, nickname, etc., to help players complete the registration process automatically.

If you are using the TDS Authentication system, refer to [Setting Other Users' Properties](/sdk/authentication/guide/#Setting Other Users' Properties) section to set user info.

If you are using the basic TapTap Login, refer to the following flow chart:

*Reference the TapTap Login Guide.

### Provide a Switch Account Function

We recommend providing players with a Switch Account function in-game.

- When switching accounts, the player will be logged out. This guarantees that other in-game services (i.e. Moments) stay consistent with the logged-in account.
- When players have logged out, automatically display the login screen with the option for players to log in with another account.

### Provide a Bind Account Function

We recommend providing players with a Bind Account function. This gives players additional login methods.

If you are using TDS Authentication to create the account system, refer to [Binding Third-Party Accounts](/sdk/authentication/guide/#binding-third-party-accounts) section.

If you have your own account system and only use the basic TapTap Login, the game must have a Bind Account function so players can bind their game account with their unique ID returned after logging into TapTap.

## Checklist

Prior to providing players with a login function, developers must test the login process to see if it can be completed as intended. Check the following:

- Whether the game meets [SDK Environment Requirements](/sdk/start/quickstart/#environment-requirements).
- Whether the developer understands the two TapTap Login methods in TapSDK. See [Integrating TapTap Login](/sdk/taptap-login/guide/start/).
- Whether the TapTap developer added the corresponding Android or iOS platform configurations to the backend. See [Configure Signature Certification](/sdk/start/quickstart/#configure-signature-certificate) and [Format Requirements](/sdk/taptap-login/features/#format-requirements).
- Whether users without the TapTap app can log in using WebView. Then check if the developer is able to obtain players' authorized basic info.
- Whether users with the most recent TapTap app can open the game and log in. Then check if the developer is able to obtain players' authorized basic info.
- Whether Silent Login is available after logging out once login authorization is complete. See [Silent Login](/sdk/taptap-login/features/#performing-silent-login).
- Whether the login process will restart upon leaving and re-entering the game without completing login authorization.

TapSupport assists the game operation teams in solving problems encountered by players faster and better.

## Key Benefits

### Rich Tools to Improve Customer Support Efficiency

TapSupport consists of two core systems: Ticket and Knowledge Base, providing a set of freely combinable functional modules, including announcements, FAQs, forms, etc., to solve players' problems and requests.

- The ticket module comes with the category-based auto-assignment function. You can also customize triggers to achieve a more complex assignment mechanism that can quickly assign tickets to the most appropriate staff members.
    
- Tickets support custom fields that can be filled in by the player or the developer via a form, providing detailed context for the staff.
    
- Multiple notification methods are supported to ensure you don't miss any player responses.
    

### Multi-dimensional Analytics to Support Operations

TapSupport is designed to help solve player problems, but it is also designed to help the operation team identify issues, refine valuable content, and improve the game itself.

- The ticket module has flexible search and filtering capabilities and support aggregation and analysis by category, field, and status. It also supports data export for further analysis with third-party tools.
    
- Users can leave feedback on knowledge base articles so that you can see behind the scenes what content is effective and what is not solving the player's problem.
    

### Simple and Powerful Management Features

TapSupport provides an intuitive role-based permission control system that supports custom roles in addition to pre-built roles for more flexible needs.

The system provides managers with detailed data to evaluate the quantity and quality of customer support work, including but not limited to the number of tickets handled, the timeliness of responses to players, and player satisfaction.

### User Experience Designed for Players

As a customer support tool focused on gaming scenarios, TapSupport provides an in-game customer support experience. Players don't have to switch apps to use the TapSupport feature, and they can receive in-game prompts immediately after customer support replies.

In addition, the SDK optimizes visuals and interactions for landscape scenarios and provides developers with a control API to reduce the impact of the SDK on the performance of the game's core processes.

### Out-of-the-box Development Experience

The TapSupport client SDK covers popular game development platforms and provides features such as user interface, login, data reporting, and badge maintenance. The highly integrated features provide an out-of-the-box development experience.

TapSupport supports multiple login methods. If the game is already using the TDS built-in account, you can log in directly by using it. It also supports logging in with the game's own account system.

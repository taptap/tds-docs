The Customer Service module has a separate permissions system from the Developer Center section. Permissions consist of two parts: roles and scopes.

- Role: determines which functions and actions a user can use;
- Scope: determines which work orders a user can access.

### Roles

User roles are categorized into the following according to their different responsibilities:

| user role                  | remit                                                                                                                        | access path                | billing    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| Manufacturer Administrator | Maintenance services and security-related configurations                                                                     | Developer Center           | not billed |
| Administrator              | daily management<br/><small>Has all configuration permissions except for service and security related configurations</small> | Customer Service Workbench | billing    |
| Customer Service           | Communicate directly with players and handle player requests                                                                 | Customer Service Workbench | billing    |

Vendor Administrators are Tap users with customer service privileges in the Developer Center. Users in other roles are independent users of the customer service system who log in to use the customer service module through the Customer Service Workbench, which is separate from the Developer Center, and are collectively referred to as "Members". Members can be added by vendor administrators in the Developer Center or by administrators in the Customer Service Workbench. A member can have one or more user roles, and vendor administrators or administrators can modify the roles of members.

The detailed correspondence between roles and permissions is as follows:

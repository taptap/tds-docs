The Customer Service module has a separate authority system from the Developer Center section. Authorities consist of two parts: role and scope.

- Role: determines which functions and actions a user can use;
- Scope: determines which work orders a user can access.

### Roles

User roles are categorized into the following categories according to their different responsibilities:

| user role                  | remit                                                                                                                        | access path                | billing    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| Super Administrator | Maintenance services and security-related configurations                                                                     | Developer Center           | not billed |
| Administrator              | daily management<br/><small>Has all configuration permissions except for service and security related configurations</small> | Customer Service Workbench | billing    |
| Customer Service           | Communicate directly with players and handle player requests                                                                 | Customer Service Workbench | billing    |

Super Administrators are Tap users with TapSupport authorities in the Developer Center. Users in other roles are independent users of the customer service system who log in to use the TapSupport module through the TapSupport Workbench, which is separate from the Developer Center, and are collectively referred to as "Members". Members can be added by super administrators in the Developer Center or by administrators in the TapSupport Workbench. A member can have one or more user roles, and super administrators or administrators can modify the roles of members.

The detailed correspondence between roles and permissions is as follows:

### Scope

If a user has the "Access Tickets" permission, there are three different scopes of work orders that he/she can access as follows:

- All Tickets
- Only Tickets for their group
- Only Tickets assigned to this user only

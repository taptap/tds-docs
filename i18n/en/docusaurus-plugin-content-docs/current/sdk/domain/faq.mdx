### Can't development apps be filed in LeanCloud?

Due to our limited operational staff, we are unable to assist development apps with additional filings.

It is recommended to consider other ways to continue using our service, such as:

- Transfer to [LeanCloud International Edition](https://leancloud.app), the international edition does not need to bind a domain name and does not need to be filed.
- Go to the IaaS service provider to complete the filing and access by yourself. Our North China node is cooperating with UCloud, and our East China node is cooperating with Tencent Cloud. You can choose the appropriate IaaS service provider according to the node of your application to file.
- Upgrade to commercial version.

### What about older versions of clients?

Older versions of clients for applications that are bound to their own domain name will continue to use the shared domain name originally provided by LeanCloud because they can't be upgraded in a timely manner.
We currently support these requests for compatibility with older clients.
However, shared domains are not guaranteed to be available and we plan to take them offline in the future, so please upgrade your client as soon as possible.

### What about SSL certificates for domains with HTTPS enabled?

API custom domains must have HTTPS enabled.
For cloud engine customized domain names and file service customized domain names, HTTPS is optional.

If HTTPS is enabled, we provide two ways of SSL certificate configuration:

- Developers manually upload their own certificate, renew the certificate by themselves and re-upload it before the certificate expires.
- Automatically apply and maintain Let's Encrypt certificate for the domain name.

Which way to choose, developers can decide by themselves.

### Can I use the same subdomain between different applications?

It is not possible to use the same subdomain for different applications.

### Does switching between development and commercial versions of an application have any effect on domain bindings?

Domain binding is not affected by switching between development and commercial versions.

</Conditional>

### Does application transfer have any effect on domain binding?

After the app transfer, if the original domain owner doesn't delete the DNS resolution records, all the requests will still go to the <Conditional brand="leancloud">LeanCloud</Conditional><Conditional brand="tds">TDS</Conditional> backend cluster. Conditional> back-end cluster, and these requests are handled normally. If the original domain owner deletes the DNS resolution records and the new developer does not bind to the new domain, then theoretically the traffic accessed using the original domain would never reach the <Conditional brand="leancloud">LeanCloud</Conditional><Conditional brand=" tds">TDS</Conditional> cluster, the transferred application is essentially unavailable.

If the new owner of the application needs to change the domain name, he or she can do so by first adding a new binding and then deleting the old domain name.
Multiple access domains are supported for the same service for the same application, so that developers can have a smooth transition when they need to switch domains.

### What domain name do I need to bind to in order to use the Cloud Functions service?

Applications that use cloud functions (including hook functions) need to bind the API domain name.

If you are hosting a website on a cloud engine, you need to bind the cloud engine domain name.

If you're really not sure, you can bind both (you need to bind different domains, which can be different subdomains of the same domain, such as `api.example.com` and `web.example.com`), so you're all set.


### If the file domain name has been changed in the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), or if the file domain name has been canceled and re-filed, the domain name will be reported as "domain name frozen" when binding the domain name.

If there is a change in the filing information of a domain name in MIIT, or if a domain name is canceled and then re-filed, the domain name will be reported as "Domain Name Frozen" when you bind the domain name. In this case, you can contact us through the work order to apply for unfreezing.

### Does a development app need to be accessed for record keeping?

Commercial applications, API customized domain names and cloud engine customized domain names used by development applications all need to be accessed for filing (different sub-domains under the same domain name do not need to be accessed for filing repeatedly). For Development apps, you need to [purchase a standalone IP](/sdk/domain/guide/#standalone-ip) first and then submit the required documents for access filing via work order.

### I'm developing an application but don't want to buy a separate IP, can I still file for access?

No. You need to submit IP address information in the access filing application. If you have a commercial application under your name, we will give you a free IP.
If you do not have a commercial version of your application, you will need to purchase a separate IP on your own.
At this time, we are unable to assist with access filings for applications that do not have a standalone IP.

### What happens if I later unsubscribe from the standalone IP used for filing?

If the Administration or the underlying IaaS service provider detects that the IP does not match the domain name in the access filing, they will order a correction or even revoke the access filing. It is recommended that you do not unsubscribe from a separate IP unless the domain name is no longer in use.

### Can't I submit a work order for the development version of the application?

Previously, work orders were only open to commercial applications, but now, in order to assist the development version of the application for access filing, the work order system is also open to the development version of the application, but the development version of the application can only be submitted under the category of "access filing" work orders.

### Deploying the server-side project of the cloud engine, if there is an error in the custom domain name request interface: ```Provisional headers are shown```.

This error is mostly due to the problem of binding a customized domain name in the cloud engine with the SSL certificate uploaded by yourself, you can use the following two SSL certificate checker tools to input the domain name bound in the cloud engine and then check it:
* https://www.myssl.cn/tools/check-server-cert.html
* https://myssl.com/ssl.html 

If the result is: "Server lacks intermediate certificate" or "Certificate chain is incomplete", you can enter https://myssl.com/chain_download.html for certificate repair. You can go to  to repair the certificate;

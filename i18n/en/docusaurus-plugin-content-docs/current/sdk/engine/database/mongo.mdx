LeanDB MongoDB is the hosted database provided by Cloud Engine. You can have your project connect to the database using MongoDB libraries and have access to all the functions provided by MongoDB. See [Cloud Engine Overview](/sdk/engine/overview) to learn about the other hosted database services provided by Cloud Engine.

## Creating and Managing Instances

You can create and manage LeanDB MongoDB instances on **<Path to="engine" /> > Database > MongoDB**.

### Creating Instances

<LeandbCreateInstance>

- **Specification** You can choose from `512M`, `1GB`, `2GB`, `4GB`, and `8GB`.

Each specification has its limit on the number of connections and the space. Upgrade to a higher specification to allow for more connections and space.

</LeandbCreateInstance>

### MongoDB Version

LeanDB only provides MongoDB 4.0 at this time.

### Resizing Online

At this time, you can’t resize LeanDB MongoDB instances on your own. Please reach out to us if you need to have your instances resized.

### Sharing Instances

You can use the “Manage sharing” function to share your LeanDB instances with other applications. When you share an instance with another application, the instance will appear in this application. The relevant environment variables will also be available in this application’s Cloud Engine instances.

## Accessing From Cloud Engine

When you deploy a project to the Cloud Engine instances under an application, some environment variables containing information for connecting to MongoDB will be injected, including:

- `MONGODB_URL_<NAME>`

Here `<NAME>` is the name you provided when creating your LeanDB instance. If the name of your LeanDB instance is `MYDB`, there will be an environment variable named `MONGODB_URL_MYDB`.

<EngineRuntimes>
<TabItem value='nodejs'>

To connect to MongoDB from Node.js (assuming the instance name is `MYDB`):

```js title='app.js'
const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");

const mongoClient = new MongoClient(process.env["MONGODB_URL_MYDB"], {
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
  poolSize: 10,
});

mongoClient
  .connect()
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Connected to MongoDB");
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.eror("Connect to MongoDB failed", err.message);
  });

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  const cats = mongoClient.collection("cats");

  res.json(cats.find({}, { limit: 10 }));
});
```

- Make sure to install the dependencies used in the code above with `npm install mongodb`
- See [MongoDB Node Driver’s docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/) for more information

<TabItem value='dotnet'>

To connect to MongoDB from .NET (assuming the instance name is `MYDB`):

```cs
string url = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MONGODB_URL_MYDB");
MongoClient client = new MongoClient(url);
IMongoCollection<BsonDocument> collection = client.GetDatabase("leancloud")
    .GetCollection<BsonDocument>("hello");
FilterDefinition<BsonDocument> filter = Builders<BsonDocument>.Filter.Empty;
Console.WriteLine(collection.Find(filter).ToList().ToJson());
```

## Managing Data

Besides accessing LeanDB with your code from Cloud Engine, you can also use the following ways to manage, debug, or perform operations on your instances.

### Connecting With the CLI

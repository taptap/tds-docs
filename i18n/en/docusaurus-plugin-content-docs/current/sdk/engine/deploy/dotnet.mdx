:::info
This article serves as a thorough introduction to Cloud Engine’s .NET runtime environment. To quickly get started with Cloud Engine, see [Getting Started With Cloud Engine](/sdk/engine/deploy/getting-started).
:::

A .NET project has to have an `app.sln` under its root directory for Cloud Engine to correctly identify it as a .NET project. The structure of a .NET project often looks like this:

```
├── web
|    ├── StartUp.cs
|    ├── Program.cs
|    ├── web.csproj
|    └── wwwroot
|        ├── css
|        ├── lib
|        └── js
├── app.sln
└── global.json
```

If you are looking to start a new project, we recommend that you use our [.NET sample project](https://github.com/leancloud/dotnet-core-getting-started) as a boilerplate.

## Startup Command

Once the build process is complete, Cloud Engine will start your application with `dotnet release/web.dll`.

## .NET Version

At this time, Cloud Engine only provides .NET 2.1.500 for running your project.

## Install Dependencies and Build

Cloud Engine will install dependencies with `dotnet restore app.sln` and build your project with `dotnet publish -o release -c Release`.

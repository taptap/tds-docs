:::info
This article serves as a thorough introduction to Cloud Engine’s Python runtime environment. To quickly get started with Cloud Engine, see [Getting Started With Cloud Engine](/sdk/engine/deploy/getting-started).
:::

A Python project has to have a `wsgi.py` and `requirements.txt` under its root directory for Cloud Engine to correctly identify it as a Python project.

By default, Cloud Engine runs Python projects with WSGI. It will load the module `wsgi.py` and call the global variable `application` in it as a WSGI function. Therefore, please ensure that `wsgi.py` contains a global variable/function/class named `application` that complies with the [WSGI specification](https://peps.python.org/pep-0333/):

```python title='app.py'
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return "hi"
```

```python title='wsgi.py'
from app import app
application = app
```

Most popular Python-based web frameworks come with support for WSGI, including [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), and [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/). We provide the following Flask- and Django-based boilerplates for you to reference and start your project with:

- [Flask](https://github.com/leancloud/python-getting-started)
- [Django](https://github.com/leancloud/django-getting-started)

## Run Without WSGI

You can run Python programs on Cloud Engine without using WSGI, or you can host your own WSGI server as well. To do so, create a file named `leanengine.yaml` and add the following configuration:

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
run: python app.py
```

Make sure that your app listens on the port specified by the environment variable `LEANCLOUD_APP_PORT` to provide HTTP services.

## Configure Python Version

Cloud Engine is compatible with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)’s `.python-version`. You can place this file under the root directory of your project to specify the Python version you want to use:

```plain title='.python-version'
3.10
```

Cloud Engine will install Python with the version specified in this file.

At this time, Cloud Engine only supports CPython. It doesn’t support other Python implementations including PyPy, Jython, and IronPython.

:::note

<Conditional brand="leancloud">For newly created apps, if</Conditional>
<Conditional brand="tds">If</Conditional> you don’t specify a Python version,
the latest stable version will be used.
<Conditional brand="leancloud">
  {" "}
  For apps created before 9/2/2021, Python `2.7` will be used by default to ensure
  compatibility.
</Conditional>
:::

:::note
If you are using `pyenv` on your local computer, `pyenv` will follow this file to run your project with the specified Python version. We recommend that you use `pyenv` on your local computer so that the environment on your local computer will be the same as that on the server. See [pyenv’s GitHub repository](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for more information on how to install `pyenv`.
:::

## Install Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

Cloud Engine will install the packages specified in [requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) with `pip`:

```plain title='requirements.txt'
leancloud>=2.9.1,<3.0.0
Flask>=1.0.0
```

:::note
We recommend that you specify the major version of your packages using a format like `leancloud>=2.9.1,<3.0.0`. This prevents incompatible changes introduced by major version bumps from causing problems during the deployments of your application.

## Customize Build Process

<BuildingAdvanced>

#### Start Projects With uWSGI

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
run: uwsgi --gevent 5000 --http :3000 --wsgi-file wsgi.py --master --process=${LEANCLOUD_AVAILABLE_CPUS} --disable-log
```

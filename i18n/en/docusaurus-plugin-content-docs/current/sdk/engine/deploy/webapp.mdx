You can deploy frontend apps (like websites) to Cloud Engine. For apps built with frameworks like React and Vue, their build processes can be run on Cloud Engine so you don’t have to clutter your Git repositories with production builds or set up additional CI environments. With Cloud Engine, you can easily bind custom domains to your app, set up auto-renewal for SSL certificates, and enable HTTPS redirects. These features help you reduce the time spent on deploying and maintaining your app.

:::info
This article serves as an introduction to Cloud Engine’s frontend runtime environment. For features provided by the Cloud Engine platform, see [Cloud Engine Platform Features](/sdk/engine/platform).
:::

If your project has a file named `static.json` or `index.html` under its root directory, Cloud Engine will identify it as a frontend project. When you deploy your project, Cloud Engine will build it with the Node.js runtime environment and automatically start an HTTP server with [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve).

## Getting Started

Most frontend scaffolds can be deployed to Cloud Engine with little to no configurations. Consider using them if you plan to create a new project.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value='react' label='React' default>

[create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) provides out-of-the-box toolchains that automatically set up build tools for your React project so you can focus on development:

```sh
npx create-react-app react-for-engine --use-npm
```

Then navigate to the project’s directory (`react-for-engine` in the example above) and create a configuration file named `static.json` that rewrites non-existing URLs to `index.html`. This allows your single-page application to use its own frontend router (like `react-router`):

```json title='static.json'
{
  "public": "build",
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "**", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

Then create a file named `leanengine.yaml` and specify the build command in it:

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
build: npm run build
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='vue' label='Vue'>

You can create a Vue project with [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/):

```sh
npm install -g @vue/cli
vue create vue-for-engine
```

Then navigate to the project’s directory (`vue-for-engine` in the example above) and create a configuration file named `static.json` that rewrites non-existing URLs to `index.html`. This allows your single-page application to use its own frontend router (like `vue-router`):

```json title='static.json'
{
  "public": "dist",
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "**", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

Then create a file named `leanengine.yaml` and specify the build command in it:

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
build: npm run build
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='nextjs' label='Next.js'>

You can create a Next.js project with [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app):

```
npx create-next-app next-for-engine --use-npm
```

Then navigate to the project’s directory (`next-for-engine` in the example above), create a file named `leanengine.yaml`, and specify the build command in it:

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
build: npm run build
```

:::info

In order for Next.js [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) to work, Cloud Engine will run the project in a [Node.js runtime environment](/sdk/engine/deploy/nodejs/) by starting a [Next.js production server](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli#production) with `npm start`. The section below regarding configuring serve won’t be applicable to Next.js projects.

The build process can be run on Cloud Engine so you don’t have to include a production build in your Git repository or set up additional CI environments.

### Deploy to Cloud Engine

<QuickStartDeploy />

## Configure Node.js Version

<NodejsSetupRuntime />

## Install Dependencies (`package.json`)

<NodejsSetupDependencies />

## Configure serve

To customize the behavior of serve, create a file named `static.json` under the root directory of your project.

```json title='static.json'
{
  "public": "build", // Start the website from the `build` directory rather than the root directory
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "**", "destination": "/index.html" } // Redirect all non-existing URLs to `index.html` (applicable to most single-page applications)
  ]
}
```

See [serve-handler · Options](https://github.com/vercel/serve-handler#options) for more options and usages of serve.

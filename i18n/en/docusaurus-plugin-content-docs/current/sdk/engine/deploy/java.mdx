:::info
This article serves as a thorough introduction to Cloud Engine’s Java runtime environment. To quickly get started with Cloud Engine, see [Getting Started With Cloud Engine](/sdk/engine/deploy/getting-started).
:::

You can deploy WAR and JAR projects built with Maven to Cloud Engine, or upload WAR files directly to Cloud Engine.

If you are looking to start a new project, we recommend that you use one of our sample projects as a boilerplate:

- [Servlet sample project](https://github.com/leancloud/servlet-getting-started)
- [Spring Boot sample project](https://github.com/leancloud/spring-boot-getting-started)

:::caution
Running a Java program usually costs a large amount of memory. If you are using a trial instance with 256M of memory, Cloud Engine might encounter an OOM error when starting your Java program, causing your deployment to fail. Even if Cloud Engine is able to start your program, the program might frequently get restarted due to low memory.

We recommend that you pick an instance with at least 512 MB of memory. If your project is built with Spring Boot, a minimum of 1024 MB of memory is recommended. You can adjust the memory size at any time even if you've already deployed your project. See [Cloud Engine Platform Features § Adjusting Quota and Number of Instances](/sdk/engine/platform/#adjusting-quota-and-number-of-instances) for more information on how to adjust the memory size of your instances.
:::

## Startup Command

Once the build is finished, Cloud Engine will look for a `.war` or `.jar` file under `target`:

- If it finds a `.war` file, it will place the file into a Servlet container (Jetty 9.x).
- If it finds a `.jar` file, it will run the file with `java -jar`.

### Configure JVM Parameters

When Cloud Engine runs a Java application, it will give `-Xmx` a value equivalent to 70% of the size of the instance. The remaining 30% will be reserved for off-heap memory and other consumptions. You may customize the value of `-Xmx` if your application has special needs (like using a large amount of off-heap memory). For example, if your instance has a memory of 2 GB, you can add a _custom environment variable_ on Cloud Engine’s _Settings_ page with `JAVA_OPTS` as its name and `-Xmx1500m` as its value. This will limit the size of the JVM heap to 1.5 GB and leave 500 MB for PermGen, off-heap memory, and other stuff. **Keep in mind that if the value of `-Xmx` is too small, a large amount of CPU might be wasted on repetitive garbage collection tasks.**

## Configure Java Version

To specify the Java version you want to use, create a file named `system.properties` under the root directory of your project:

```plain title='system.properties'
java.runtime.version=11
```

At this time, Cloud Engine supports AdoptOpenJDK `8`, `11`, `12`, `13`, and `14`.

  For apps created before 9/2/2021, Java `8` will be used by default to ensure compatibility.
</Conditional>
:::

## Upload WAR File

If you’ve already built the WAR file on your local computer (with commands like `mvn package`), you can add the `--war` option when you deploy your project with the CLI. This tells the CLI to upload the WAR file rather than the source code.

<CodeBlock className="sh">{`${CLI_BINARY} deploy --war`}</CodeBlock>

In this case, Cloud Engine won’t install dependencies or build your project on the server side. Instead, it will run the WAR file by placing it into a Servlet container.

## Install Dependencies and Build

If you’ve uploaded the source code, Cloud Engine will install the dependencies listed in `pom.xml` with Maven and build your project by running `mvn package`.

## Customize Build Process

<BuildingAdvanced>

#### Upload Jar Without Building on the Server

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
runtime: java
install: []
build: []
run: java -jar your-package.jar
```

Here we have specified that we are using the Java Runtime Environment. We have skipped the dependency installation and build steps by leaving them empty. We also specified the run command (run `your-package.jar` in the root directory).

## Troubleshooting

### Can I run my Cloud Engine Java project locally without using the CLI?

Once you have configured the environment variables required for running your project on Cloud Engine, you can run your Java project locally with certain commands or using an IDE without using the CLI.

To run a Jetty or JAR project from the command line, first configure the environment variables:

```sh
eval "$(lean env)"
```

Notice that `lean env` outputs the commands used to configure the environment variables required for the current application. You can use `eval` to execute these commands.
If you’re using Windows, you need to manually configure the environment variables returned by `lean env`.

If you have a Jetty project, run the following command:

```
mvn jetty:run
```

If you have a JAR project, package it with Maven and run the following command:

```sh
mvn package
java -jar target/{zipped jar file}
```

To run the application with Eclipse:

Please first make sure that you have installed the Maven plugin with Eclipse, then import the project into Eclipse as a **Maven Project**.

After this, right-click on the project under the **Package Explorer** view:

- For a Jetty project, select **Run As** > **Maven build…** and set **Goals** under the **Main** tab to be `jetty:run`.
- For a JAR project, select **Run As** > **Run Configurations…**, select `Application`, and set `Main class:` (`cn.leancloud.demo.todo.Application` for the sample project).

Then add the following environment variables under the **Environment** tab:

| Name                       | Value           |
| -------------------------- | --------------- |
| `LEANCLOUD_APP_ENV`        | `development`   |
| `LEANCLOUD_APP_ID`         | `{{appid}}`     |
| `LEANCLOUD_APP_KEY`        | `{{appkey}}`    |
| `LEANCLOUD_APP_MASTER_KEY` | `{{masterkey}}` |
| `LEANCLOUD_APP_PORT`       | `3000`          |

Once you’ve finished the configuration above, you will be able to run your project by hitting _run_.

### If my project depends on private libraries, can I use them on Cloud Engine?

You can follow the instructions below to use private libraries on Cloud Engine:

1. Create a directory named `libs` under the root directory of your project, then copy all the jar files your project depends on into it.
2. Create a file named `leanengine.yaml` under the root directory of your project, then customize the `install` stage (see the example below).
3. Edit the dependencies in `pom.xml` and add `includeSystemScope` into `spring-boot-maven-plugin` in the same file (see the example below).

Your project structure will look like this:

```
{root}
|---libs
|       |- yourdependency.jar etc.
|---leanengine.yaml
\---pom.xml
```

`leanengine.yaml` will look like this:

```yaml
install:
  - require:
      - libs
  - { use: "default" }
```

To add dependencies into `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sample</groupId>
    <artifactId>sample</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
    <scope>system</scope>
    <systemPath>${project.basedir}/libs/yourdependency.jar</systemPath>
</dependency>
```

Edit `spring-boot-maven-plugin` in `pom.xml` so it looks like this:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <executable>true</executable>
    <includeSystemScope>true</includeSystemScope>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

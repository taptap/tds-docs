:::info
This article serves as a thorough introduction to Cloud Engine’s C++ runtime environment. To quickly get started with Cloud Engine, see [Getting Started With Cloud Engine](/sdk/engine/deploy/getting-started).
:::

Cloud Engine can be used to build projects using Bazel or Makefile (CMake).

The C++ runtime environment provides GCC 9.4 as a compiler.

## Bazel Projects

If `WORKSPACE` exists in the project root, Cloud Engine will build your project with `bazel build -c opt //:all` and run your project with `bazel run -c opt //:all`.

## Makefile (CMake) Projects

If `Makefile` exists in the project root, Cloud Engine will build your project with `make`.

If `CMakeLists.txt` exists in the project root, Cloud Engine will first create a Makefile with `cmake .`.

Cloud Engine doesn’t have a default command for running Makefile projects. You need to specify it in `leanengine.yaml`:

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
run: ./myapp
```

## Uploading Compiled Programs

You can also compile your programs on your own computer and upload them to Cloud Engine. We recommend that you compile your programs using static linking on Ubuntu 20.04.

Make sure you specify the command to run your program in `leanengine.yaml`:

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
runtime: cpp
run: ./myapp
```

:::info
There may be changes to the Cloud Engine build environment in the future. For example, the Linux distribution used by Cloud Engine might be updated. When this happens, you may need to adjust compilation options to ensure that your programs compile without errors. Versions that have already been built on Cloud Engine will not have their build environments changed, so you can continue to use them or revert back to them at any time.

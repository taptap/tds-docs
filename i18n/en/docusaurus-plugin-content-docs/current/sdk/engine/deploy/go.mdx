:::info
This article serves as a thorough introduction to Cloud Engine’s Go runtime environment. To quickly get started with Cloud Engine, see [Getting Started With Cloud Engine](/sdk/engine/deploy/getting-started).
:::

At this time, Cloud Engine can only manage dependencies with Go Modules.

A Go project has to have a `go.mod` under its root directory for Cloud Engine to correctly identify it as a Go project.

## Commands for Building and Running

By default, Cloud Engine builds your project with `go build -o main` and runs the compiled executable (`main`). You can customize the commands for building and running your project with `leanengine.yaml`:

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
build: go build -o myapp
run: ./myapp
```

## Configure Go Version

Cloud Engine will use the Go version specified in `go.mod`:

```plain title='go.mod'
go 1.14
```

:::note
If you don’t specify a Go version, the latest stable version will be used.

## Install Dependencies (`go.mod`)

Cloud Engine will automatically install the dependencies listed in `go.mod` and `go.sum`.

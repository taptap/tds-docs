## Deploying Apps

:::tip
Ready to deploy your first app? Check out [this guide](/sdk/engine/deploy/getting-started/) to learn how to get your app running on Cloud Engine in seconds. From there you can explore the different runtime environments supported by Cloud Engine.

## 部署游戏后端

除了部署 Web 应用外，云引擎还为游戏后端提供了额外的支持，包括使用 TCP 或 UDP 协议、最长 60 分钟的平滑关闭、允许客户端连接到指定实例等功能，你可以在云引擎所支持的所有运行环境中使用这些功能。

你可以先阅读 [游戏后端参考架构](/sdk/engine/game/architecture) 来了解在云引擎上运行游戏后端的推荐架构，或者从 [快速开始部署游戏后端](/sdk/engine/game/getting-started) 开始部署第一个应用，然后在 [游戏后端开发指南](/sdk/engine/game/guides) 中了解详细的接入方法。

## Cloud Functions and Hooks

Cloud Functions lets you run backend code on the cloud in response to various types of events. It automatically serializes objects that have the data types provided by our <Conditional brand="tds">[Data Storage](/sdk/storage/features)</Conditional><Conditional brand="leancloud">[Data Storage](https://docs.leancloud.app/storage_overview.html)</Conditional> service and is supported by our client-side SDKs. Hooks allows you to trigger custom logics or perform additional permission checks when there are objects created, updated, or deleted in the Data Storage service, users logged in or verified, or messages sent, conversations created, or clients logged in or logged out in the Instant Messaging service.

:::tip
You can start using Cloud Functions with little experience in traditional backend development. Check out [this guide](/sdk/engine/functions/getting-started/) to learn how to write your first Cloud Function.
:::

Cloud Functions comes with features like [Scheduled Tasks](/sdk/engine/functions/guides/#scheduled-tasks) and [Cloud Queue](/sdk/engine/functions/cloud-queue/) that make it convenient for you to manage your Cloud Functions in a more complex manner. You can have your Cloud Functions triggered routinely, retry failed function calls, skip duplicate function calls, look up function outputs, and delay function calls.

## LeanDB

Cloud Engine hosts a collection of popular database management systems that you can use as alternatives to the <Conditional brand="tds">[Data Storage](/sdk/storage/features)</Conditional><Conditional brand="leancloud">[Data Storage](https://docs.leancloud.app/storage_overview.html)</Conditional> service:

| DBMS          | Clusters               | Cluster availability                                                        | Documentation                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Redis         | Master/slave (1M/1S)   | High availability by default with automatic failover                        | [LeanCache Guide](/sdk/engine/database/redis/)         |
| MongoDB       | Replica set (1P/1S/1A) | High availability by default with automatic failover                        | [LeanDB MongoDB Guide](/sdk/engine/database/mongo/)    |
| MySQL         | Master/slave (1M/1S)   | High availability by default with automatic failover                        | [LeanDB MySQL Guide](/sdk/engine/database/mysql/)      |
| Elasticsearch | One or three nodes     | High availability by default with automatic failover when using three nodes | [LeanDB Elasticsearch Guide](/sdk/engine/database/es/) |

- With the **CLI**, you can easily deploy and debug projects that use Cloud Functions. See [CLI Guide](/sdk/engine/cli/) for more information.
- You can use Cloud Functions with its **REST API** besides the Data Storage SDK. See [Cloud Engine REST API Guide](/sdk/engine/functions/rest-api/) for more information.
- If you have a **dedicated IP**, you can bind it to your Cloud Engine instances. See [Dedicated IP for Cloud Engine](/sdk/engine/dedicated-IP) for more information.
- For those curious about the stuff behind the scenes, [Deep Dive Into Cloud Engine](/sdk/engine/deep-dive/) lists a few technical details about Cloud Engine.

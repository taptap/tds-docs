This article serves as a thorough introduction to Cloud Engine’s REST API. To learn about Cloud Functions and hooks, see [Cloud Functions and Hooks Guide](/sdk/engine/functions/guides).
:::

Cloud Engine offers a REST API for users to access Cloud Functions. When you invoke Cloud Functions using our SDKs, the SDKs use the same API for accessing our service.

We recommend that you use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing the REST API.

## Base URL

The base URL of the REST API is the API domain of your application (represented with `{{host}}`). You can bind and view API domains on the dashboard. See <Conditional brand="tds">[Domain](/sdk/storage/guide/setup-dotnet/#domain)</Conditional><Conditional brand="leancloud">[Binding Your Domains](/sdk/domain/guide/)</Conditional> for more information.

See <Conditional brand="tds">[this article](/sdk/storage/guide/rest/#request-format)</Conditional><Conditional brand="leancloud">[this article](https://docs.leancloud.app/en/sdk/storage/guide/rest/#request-format)</Conditional> for more information about the format of the request.

## Overview

| URL                                 | HTTP | Function                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /1.1/functions/&lt;functionName&gt; | POST | Invoke a Cloud Function                                                |
| /1.1/call/&lt;functionName&gt;      | POST | Invoke a Cloud Function with `LCObject`s as the argument or the result |

## Staging Environment vs. Production Environment

When invoking Cloud Functions from the client with the REST API, you can set the HTTP header `X-LC-Prod` to specify the environment.

- `X-LC-Prod: 0` means to use the staging environment
- `X-LC-Prod: 1` means to use the production environment

When invoking Cloud Functions with the SDK, the SDK will set the HTTP header `X-LC-Prod` according to the current environment. See [Cloud Functions and Hooks Guide § Production Environment vs. Staging Environment](/sdk/engine/functions/guides/#production-environment-vs-staging-environment) for more information.

## Cloud Functions

You can invoke a Cloud Function by accessing `POST /functions/:name`. Both the argument and the result are in JSON.
For example, to get the score of a movie with the movie’s name:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
       -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
       -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
       -d '{"movie":"A Quiet Place"}' \
https://{{host}}/1.1/functions/averageStars
```

Response:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "movie": "A Quiet Place",
    "stars": "2.5"
  }
}
```

If a user needs to be used to invoke the Cloud Function, provide the `sessionToken` of the user through `X-LC-Session`:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Session: qmdj8pdidnmyzp0c7yqil91oc" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/functions/hello
```

If you need to use `LCObject`s as the argument or the result of a Cloud Function, you can invoke the function with RPC by accessing `POST /1.1/call/:name`:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"__type": "Object", "className": "Post", "pubUser": "LeanCloud Staff"}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/call/addPost
```

Response:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "__type": "Object",
    "className": "Post",
    "pubUser": "Staff"
  }
}
```

When invoking a Cloud Function with RPC, you can provide or receive an object containing multiple `LCObject`s.
For example, if a Cloud Function returns an array containing a number and a `Todo` object, the result of the RPC invocation would be:

```json
{
  "result": [
    1,
    {
      "title": "R&D Weekly Meeting",
      "createdAt": {
        "__type": "Date",
        "iso": "2019-04-28T08:34:12.932Z"
      },
      "updatedAt": {
        "__type": "Date",
        "iso": "2019-04-28T08:34:12.932Z"
      },
      "objectId": "5cc5658443e78cb53fe7b731",
      "__type": "Object",
      "className": "Todo"
    }
  ]
}
```

When invoking a Cloud Function with RPC using the SDK, the SDK will automatically deserialize everything.

If a timeout occurs, the client will get a response with its HTTP status code being 503, 524, or 141.

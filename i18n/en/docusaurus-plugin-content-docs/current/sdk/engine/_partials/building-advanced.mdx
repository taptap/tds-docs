You can override the default behavior by specifying startup commands (`run`), dependency installation commands (`install`), and build commands (`build`) in `leanengine.yaml`:

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
run: echo 'run another command'
install:
  - {use: 'default'}
  - echo 'install additional dependencies here'
build:
  - echo 'overwrite default build command here'
```

### System Dependencies

You can specify the system dependencies provided by the server-side environment using `leanengine.yaml`:

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
systemDependencies:
  - imagemagick
```

See [Reference: leanengine.yaml](/sdk/engine/deep-dive/leanengine-yaml#systemdependencies-系统级依赖) for a complete list of supported system dependencies.

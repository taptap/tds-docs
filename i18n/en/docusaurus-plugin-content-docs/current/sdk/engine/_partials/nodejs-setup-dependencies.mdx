Cloud Engine will automatically install dependencies according to the `package.json` in your project:

```json title='package.json'
{
  "dependencies": {
    "leancloud-storage": "^3.11.0",
    "leanengine": "^3.3.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^1.18.7"
  }
}
```

While installing dependencies, Cloud Engine will trigger the [life cycle scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scripts#life-cycle-scripts) of npm, such as `postinstall` and `prepare`.

:::note
If your project contains `package-lock.json`, Cloud Engine will install dependencies with `npm ci` (requires Node.js 10 or higher). Otherwise, Cloud Engine will install dependencies with `npm install --production`, which means that dependencies listed under `devDependencies` will not be installed.
:::

:::note
If your project contains `yarn.lock`, Cloud Engine will install dependencies with `yarn` (requires Node.js 4.8 or higher). To use npm instead of Yarn, add `yarn.lock` into `.gitignore` (if deploying with Git) or `.leanignore` (if deploying with the CLI). Since `yarn.lock` contains the URLs for downloading dependencies, please carefully choose the registry for your project, or you may experience increased build time.
:::

Since Cloud Engine installs dependencies on the server side, the CLI won’t upload `node_modules` by default. If you’re deploying with Git, you should include `node_modules` in `.gitignore` so it won’t be tracked by Git.

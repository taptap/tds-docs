Projects deployed to Cloud Engine can only be accessed with domains configured. You can bind domains by going to **<Path to="engine" /> > Manage deployment > Your group > Settings > Domains**.

<Conditional if={!props.noStaging}>

If you bind a domain that starts with `stg-` (e.g., `stg-api.example.com`), it will be assigned to the staging environment automatically.

</Conditional>

<Conditional if={HAS_SUB_DOMAIN}>

We provide shared domains for apps that are still under testing. You can assign your app a shared domain with a prefix of your choice.

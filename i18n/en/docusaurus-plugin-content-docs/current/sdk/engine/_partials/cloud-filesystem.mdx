Your application can create temporary files under `/home/leanengine` and `/tmp`. The size limit for all the files created by your application is 1 GB.

:::caution
Each time you trigger a new deployment for your application, Cloud Engine will create a new container for it. Even though you donâ€™t trigger deployments, Cloud Engine will still perform occasional maintenance operations. This means that your application **should not treat the file system provided by Cloud Engine as permanent storage**.
:::

If the files created by your application bear relatively larger sizes, we recommend that your application always cleans them up once it finishes using them. Creating more files when there are already more than 1 GB files existing might lead to the `Disk quota exceeded` error. You can trigger a deployment to quickly clean up all the temporary files.

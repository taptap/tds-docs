By default, the logs generated during the build process wonâ€™t be printed to the console. If the build process fails, the logs from the last completed step will be printed to the console.

To print the complete build log for debugging, check _Print build logs_ if you are deploying from the dashboard or add `--options 'printBuildLogs=true'` if you are deploying with the CLI.

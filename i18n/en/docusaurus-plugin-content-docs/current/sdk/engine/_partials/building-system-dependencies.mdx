You can specify the system dependencies provided by the server-side environment by setting `systemDependencies` in `leanengine.yaml`:

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
systemDependencies:
  - imagemagick
```

The following libraries are available for you to add:

- `ffmpeg` A library for processing audio and videos.
- `imagemagick` A library for processing images.
- `fonts-wqy` 文泉驿点阵宋体 and 文泉驿微米黑. Often used with `phantomjs` or `chrome-headless` to display Chinese.
- `fonts-noto` Source Han Sans (comes with a large size).
- `phantomjs` A headless browser based on WebKit (discontinued).
- `chrome-headless` Headless Chrome. It comes with a large size and will significantly increase the time needed for deployment. It also consumes a lot of CPU and RAM resources. If you need to use `puppeteer`, please provide `{executablePath: '/usr/bin/google-chrome', args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox']}` to `puppeteer.launch`. This library doesn’t support Java yet.
- `node-canvas` The system dependency required for installing `node-canvas` (you still need to install `node-canvas` yourself).
- `python-talib` A library for performing technical analysis of financial market data.

:::caution
Adding system dependencies will significantly increase the time needed for deployment. Please avoid adding dependencies that your project doesn’t need.

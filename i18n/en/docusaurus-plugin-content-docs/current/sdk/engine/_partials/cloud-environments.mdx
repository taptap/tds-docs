<Conditional brand='leancloud'>

The environment variables starting with `LC_` (like `LC_APP_ID`) used by the older version of Cloud Engine have already been deprecated. Those environment variables will still be present for a while to ensure compatibility but will eventually get removed. If you are still using them in your application, please replace them with those starting with `LEANCLOUD_`.

You can also set up custom environment variables on the dashboard to store configurations.

Cloud Engine uses the default commands of each language to complete the build process. You can override these commands by editing `leanengine.yaml`.

### Overriding Command for Execution With `run`

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
run: $(npm bin)/serve -c static.json -l ${LEANCLOUD_APP_PORT}
```

You can use shell syntax here for purposes like accessing environment variables.

### Overriding Command for Installing Dependencies With `install`

You can override the default command for installing dependencies (like `npm install`) or run additional commands before or after installing dependencies.

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
install: npm
```

Most runtimes have their default commands for installing dependencies. You can refer to the default command with `{use: 'default'}`:

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
install:
  - { use: "default" }
  - npm run install-additional
```

When installing dependencies, only the dependency lists (like `package.json`) will be loaded into the build directory. To load additional files, use `require`:

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
install:
  - require:
      - frontend/package.json
      - frontend/package-lock.json
  - cd frontend && npm ci
```

### Overriding Command for Building With `build`

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
build: npm run build
```

When building your project, all the files in your project will be loaded into the build directory.

You can specify multiple pieces of commands with an array. You can use shell syntax here as well:

```yaml title='leanengine.yaml'
build:
  - echo 'building'
  - NODE_ENV=production $(npm bin)/webpack
```

Certain runtimes have their default build commands. You can refer to these commands with `{use: 'default'}`.

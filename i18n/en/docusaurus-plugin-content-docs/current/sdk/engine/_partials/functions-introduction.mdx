Cloud Functions lets you run backend code on the cloud in response to various types of events. It is supported by our client-side SDKs and can automatically serialize objects that have the data types provided by our <Conditional brand="tds">[Data Storage](/sdk/storage/features)</Conditional><Conditional brand="leancloud">[Data Storage](https://docs.leancloud.app/storage_overview.html)</Conditional> service.

The following scenarios can be easily implemented with the help of Cloud Functions and Hooks:

- Manage complex logics in one place without implementing them with different languages for each platform.
- Adjust certain logics of your project on the server side without updating clients.
- Retrieve and update data regardless of the ACL or class permissions.
- Trigger custom logics or perform additional permission checks when objects are created, updated, or deleted, or when users are logged in or verified.
- Run scheduled tasks to fulfill requirements like closing unpaid orders every hour, deleting outdated data every midnight, etc.

You can write Cloud Functions with any of the languages (runtime environments) supported by Cloud Engine, including Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, .NET, and Go. Our dashboard provides an online editor for you to write Cloud Functions in Node.js. If you prefer using another language, please create a project based on our demo project and deploy it to Cloud Engine.

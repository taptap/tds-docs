You can download our sample project for C++ and games at:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leancloud/cpp-socket-demo.git
```

This example project contains a simple real-time multiplayer game. Let's start the project locally:

```
$ make && ./cpp-socket
[UDP] Socket is listening on 4000
[TCP] Socket is listening on 4000
[HTTP] Socket is listening on 3000
```

Use `nc` to connect to the program on the TCP port:

```
$ nc 127.0.0.1 4000
>> 1 players online, last number is 1, you must send the next number but skip numbers which multiples of 3 or includes the digit 3.
2 (your input)
>> 2 players online, 127.0.0.1:59385 sent 2.
>> 127.0.0.1:59897 lost, 2 players online.
4 (your input)
>> 1 players online, 127.0.0.1:59385 sent 4.
```

In this game, you must send the following number to the server, but skip multiples of 3 or numbers containing the number 3. If you enter it incorrectly, you will be disconnected.

## Deploy to Cloud Engine

Select the application and group:

<CodeBlock className="sh">{`${CLI_BINARY} switch`}</CodeBlock>

Deploy to production:

<CodeBlock className="sh">{`${CLI_BINARY} deploy --prod`}</CodeBlock>

For more information on command line tools and local debugging, see the [CLI Guide](/sdk/engine/cli/).

## Connect to the Game in the Cloud

Get the connection address by sending a request. You will need to replace the appId, group name, and environment (production or staging):

```
$ curl -H 'X-LC-Id: SJjoXHWuhewHKV4Ojw' 'https://shared.cloud.tds1.tapapis.cn/1.1/engine/gateway/route?groupName=udp&prod=1'

[
  {
    "name": "game",
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "publicPort": 19766,
    "publicIp": "106.75.70.96"
  }
]
```

Then you can connect with `nc`:

```
$ nc 106.75.70.96 19766
```

:::info
The IP and port may change whenever the Cloud Engine instance is deployed, restarted, or automatically maintained, so please check the server's current IP and port before each connection.

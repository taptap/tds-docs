The Cloud Engine CLI (<Command />) is a tool for you to deploy your Cloud Engine projects and manage your applications.

## Install the CLI

### macOS

You can install the CLI with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew update && brew install lean-cli
```

<details>
<summary>Having trouble using Homebrew?</summary>

If you’re having a poor connection to Homebrew’s service, you can [set up environment variables like `http_proxy` to make your connection faster](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#using-homebrew-behind-a-proxy). You can also use a mirror for Homebrew (like [TUNA](https://mirror.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/homebrew/)).

If you prefer not to use Homebrew, you can download the binary file named <Command suffix="-macos-arm64" /> (for Apple Silicon) or <Command suffix="-macos-x64" /> (for Intel) from [GitHub releases], rename the file to <Command />, and move the file to a directory listed within `$PATH`. Make sure to make the file executable by running <Command prefix="chmod a+x /path/to/" />.

</details>

### Windows

You can download the 32-bit or 64-bit **msi** file from [GitHub releases] and run the file to install the CLI. After you install the CLI, you’ll be able to use it by running <Command /> in Command Prompt or PowerShell.

You can also download the **exe** file, rename it to <Command suffix=".exe" />, and add its path to the **PATH** environment variable ([instructions](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html)). You will then be able to run <Command /> under any directory using Command Prompt or PowerShell. Besides adding the file’s path to PATH, you can also choose to move the file to a directory already listed within PATH, like `C:\Windows\System32`.

### Linux

For Debian-based distributions, you can download the deb file from [GitHub releases].

For other distributions, you can download the pre-compiled binary file (like <Command suffix="-linux-x64" />) from [GitHub releases], rename the file to <Command />, and move the file to a directory listed within `$PATH`. Make sure to make the file executable by running <Command prefix="chmod a+x /path/to/" />.

[github releases]: https://releases.leanapp.cn/#/leancloud/lean-cli/releases

### Upgrade to the Latest Version

If you have already installed the CLI, you can upgrade it to the latest version by reinstalling the CLI with the latest file.

## Usage

After installing the CLI, you can run <Command suffix=" help" /> on the terminal to view the help information:

</CodeBlock>

</details>

## Log In

The first thing you may want to do after installing the CLI is to log in to your account.

<Conditional brand='tds'>

Please go to the Developer Center, click “Create Game”, and then follow the instructions to enter your game’s information. After this, go to your game’s **Game Services > Cloud Services > Cloud Engine > Turn on now > Deploy projects > Deploy using CLI** and follow the instructions to log in to your account.

</Conditional>

To switch to a different account, run <Command suffix=" login" /> again.

## Initialize a Project

After logging in, you can initialize a project with <Command suffix=" new" />. This will also link the project to an existing application.

<QuickStartNew noCliSetup={true} />

## Link to an Application and Group

Most of the functions provided by the CLI require the project to be linked to an application. You can use <Command suffix=" switch" /> to link a project to an application:

<CodeBlock className="sh">{`${CLI_BINARY} switch`}</CodeBlock>

If your application contains multiple groups, you’ll need to pick a group as well.

To link the project to a different application, run <Command suffix=" switch" /> again.

You can also run <Command suffix=" switch <another app’s ID>" /> to quickly switch to a different application.

You can view the application linked to the current project with <Command suffix=" info" />.

## Run and Debug Locally

Run the following command under the root directory of your project to run and debug the project locally:

<CodeBlock className="sh">{`${CLI_BINARY} up`}</CodeBlock>

Besides starting your project, the CLI will also start a Cloud Function Debug Console.

- Visit <http://localhost:3000> for the homepage of a web application.
- Visit <http://localhost:3001> for the Cloud Function Debug Console (you can debug hooks as well).

To change the port for starting the project, run <Command suffix=" up --port <new port>" />.

The CLI won’t take care of auto-restart or hot-reload for your project, though some of our demo projects (like the Node.js demo project) come with the auto-restart feature.

Besides starting your project with the CLI, you can also start them **natively** using commands like `node server.js` or `python wsgi.py`. This helps if you want to integrate the development process of your Cloud Engine project into your own development process or the IDE you’re using. If you created your project with the CLI, the project would depend on certain environment variables. You will need to configure these environment variables on your own.

You can run <Command suffix=" env" /> to get the environment variables mentioned above. Once you’ve configured them on the terminal, you won’t have to start your project with the CLI anymore. If your shell is compatible with `sh`, you can also run <Command prefix="eval $(" suffix=" env)" /> to have all the environment variables configured automatically.

When starting your project, you can add custom options to the startup command by adding `--` after <Command suffix=" up" />. All the options added after `--` will be passed to the actual startup command. For example, if you want to enable the inspector by adding `--inspect` when starting a Node.js project, you can run <Command suffix=" up -- --inspect" />.

You can also start your project with any startup command by using the `--cmd` flag, like <Command suffix=" up --cmd=my-custom-command" />.

If you ever need to start your project with an IDE or debug the Cloud Functions of a project located on a virtual machine or a remote computer, you can run the Cloud Function Debug Console without running the project itself:

<CodeBlock className="sh">
  {`$ ${CLI_BINARY} debug --remote=http://remote-url-or-ip-address:remote-port --app-id=xxxxxx`}
</CodeBlock>

For more information about Cloud Engine, see [Cloud Engine Overview](/sdk/engine/overview/).

## Deploy

Starting from v1.0, <Command suffix=' deploy' /> requires that you provide an argument specifying the environment you would like to deploy your project to. If you don’t provide the argument, the CLI will ask for the environment interactively:

| Command                                | Behavior under trial mode            | Behavior under standard mode                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Command suffix=' deploy --prod' />    | Deploy to the production environment | Deploy to the production environment                                         |
| <Command suffix=' deploy --staging' /> | Not supported                        | Deploy to the staging environment                                            |
| <Command suffix=' publish' />          | Not supported                        | Publish the version in the staging environment to the production environment |

### Deploy From Local Project

Once you’ve finished developing and testing your project, you can deploy it to Cloud Engine:

<CodeBlock className="sh">{`${CLI_BINARY} deploy --prod`}</CodeBlock>

This command will deploy the project to the production environment and override the previous version deployed from a local project, Git, or the online editor.

You will see the progress during the deployment:

<CodeBlock>
  {`$ ${CLI_BINARY} deploy --prod
[INFO] lean (v1.0.0) running on darwin/arm64
[INFO] Current app: my-engine-app (xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx), group: web, region: cn-n1

[REMOTE] 部署完成：1 个实例部署成功`}
</CodeBlock>

The default message for the deployment is “Built from lean-cli”, which will be displayed on **<Path to="engine" /> > Manage deployment > Your group > Logs**. You can customize the message with `-m`:

<CodeBlock className="sh">
  {`${CLI_BINARY} deploy --prod -m 'fix #42'`}
</CodeBlock>

After deploying, you’ll need to bind a Cloud Engine domain for your application, then you’ll be able to test your project with curl or visit your site via a browser.

<details>
<summary>Ignore files with <code>.leanignore</code></summary>

If your project contains certain files that need to be skipped when your deploy your project (like temporary files or those used by source code management tools), you can add them to `.leanignore`.

`.leanignore` shares a similar format with `.gitignore` (the syntax for `.leanignore` is actually a subset of that for `.gitignore`), with every single line as a file or directory to be ignored. If your project does not contain a `.leanignore`, the CLI will automatically create one [according to the language used for the project][defaultignorepatterns]. Make sure to check if the content in the file meets the requirements of your project.

[defaultignorepatterns]: https://github.com/leancloud/lean-cli/blob/master/runtimes/ignorefiles.go#L13

</details>

### Staging Environment

If you’ve upgraded your application to the standard mode, a staging environment will be included in your application. The staging environment shares almost the same environment with the production environment and they both have access to the same data from the Data Storage services. You can bind a separate domain to the staging environment for testing purposes. While developing your project, you can deploy the changes to the staging environment first, and only publish the changes to the production environment if everything goes well in the staging environment.

To deploy to the staging environment:

<CodeBlock className="sh">{`${CLI_BINARY} deploy --staging`}</CodeBlock>

To publish the version in the staging environment to the production environment:

<CodeBlock>
  {`$ ${CLI_BINARY} publish
[INFO] Current CLI tool version:  0.21.0
[INFO] Retrieving app info ...
[INFO] Deploying AwesomeApp(xxxxxx) to region: cn group: web production
[REMOTE] 开始部署 20181207-115634 到 web1
[REMOTE] 正在创建新实例 ...
[REMOTE] 正在启动新实例 ...
[REMOTE] 实例启动成功：{"version": "2.1.8", "runtime": "cpython-3.7.1"}
[REMOTE] 正在更新云函数信息 ...
[REMOTE] 部署完成：1 个实例部署成功`}
</CodeBlock>

<Command suffix=" publish" /> guarantees that the exact same version in the staging
environment (including dependencies and the build output) will be deployed to the
production environment.

### Deploy From Git Repository

If your project is hosted on a Git platform (like [GitHub](https://github.com/)) and you have already configured the Git repository and deploy key on the dashboard, you can run the following command to have your project deployed with the source code in the repository:

<CodeBlock className="sh">{`${CLI_BINARY} deploy --prod -g`}</CodeBlock>

- `-g` means to deploy from the Git repository. Make sure it is already set up on the dashboard.
- The command will use the latest commit on the **master** branch by default. You can specify the commit or branch by adding `-r <revision>`.
- See [Cloud Engine Platform Features § Deploying With Git](/sdk/engine/platform/#deploying-with-git) for instructions on how to set up Git repository and deploy key.

## View Logs

You can view the latest logs of your application with `logs`:

<CodeBlock>
  {`$ ${CLI_BINARY} logs
      2019-11-20 17:17:12  Deploying 20191120-171431 to web1
      2019-11-20 17:17:12  Creating new instance ...
      2019-11-20 17:17:22  Starting new instance ...
web1  2019-11-20 17:17:22
web1  2019-11-20 17:17:22  > node-js-getting-started@1.0.0 start /home/leanengine/app
web1  2019-11-20 17:17:22  > node server.js
web1  2019-11-20 17:17:22

      2019-11-20 17:17:23  Cloud functions and hooks metadata updated
      2019-11-20 17:17:23  Deploy finished: 1 instances deployed`}
</CodeBlock>

The command will return 30 entries by default, with the latest ones on the bottom.

You can use the `-f` option to have logs fetched continuously (similar to using `tail -f`):

<CodeBlock className="sh">{`${CLI_BINARY} logs -f`}</CodeBlock>

Newer logs will be automatically printed to the bottom of the screen.

<details>
<summary>Advanced usage of <Command suffix=" logs" /></summary>

You can specify the number of entries returned by the CLI using the `-l` option. For example, to return the latest 100 entries:

<CodeBlock className="sh">{`${CLI_BINARY} logs -l 100`}</CodeBlock>

If you want to fetch the logs generated within a certain period of time, you can provide a `--from` and `--to` parameter:

<CodeBlock className="sh">
  {`${CLI_BINARY} logs --from=2017-07-01 --to=2017-07-07`}
</CodeBlock>

Use `--from` without `--to` if you want to fetch the logs from a certain day to the current time:

<CodeBlock className="sh">{`${CLI_BINARY} logs --from=2017-07-01`}</CodeBlock>

If you prefer viewing logs with a different tool on your computer, you can export the logs into a file in the format of JSON:

<CodeBlock className="sh">
  {`${CLI_BINARY} logs --from=2017-07-01 --to=2017-07-07 --format=json > leanengine.logs`}
</CodeBlock>

Both `--from` and `--to` use the local time zone (the time zone of the machine in which you run <Command />).

## Troubleshooting

### What should I do if the deployment failed?

There could be different reasons that could cause a deployment to fail. Please read the error message to find the specific reason.
If you’re not using the latest version of the CLI, you can try to upgrade the CLI to the latest version and try again.

### I’m seeing `Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::3000` when starting my project locally.

`listen EADDRINUSE :::3000` means the default port used by your program, 3000, is already occupied by a different program. You can find and kill the program using the port 3000 by following the instructions below:

- [For macOS, you can use `lsof` and `kill`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3855127/find-and-kill-process-locking-port-3000-on-mac)
- [For Linux, you can use `fuser`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11583562/how-to-kill-a-process-running-on-particular-port-in-linux)
- [For Windows, you can use `netstat` and `taskkill`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6204003/kill-a-process-by-looking-up-the-port-being-used-by-it-from-a-bat)

You can also change the default port used by the CLI:

<CodeBlock className="sh">{`${CLI_BINARY} -p 3002`}</CodeBlock>

### How to upload files with the CLI?

<CodeBlock className="sh">
  {`$ ${CLI_BINARY} file upload public/index.html
Uploads /Users/dennis/programming/avos/new_app/public/index.html successfully at: http://ac-7104en0u.qiniudn.com/f9e13e69-10a2-1742-5e5a-8e71de75b9fc.html`}
</CodeBlock>

You will get a URL for each file successfully uploaded. That’s the message shown after `successfully at:` in the example above.

To upload all the files under `images`:

<CodeBlock className="sh">{`${CLI_BINARY} file upload images/`}</CodeBlock>

### How to deploy the same project to multiple applications?

You can switch to a different application with <Command suffix=" switch" /> and deploy the project with <Command suffix=" deploy --prod" />. <Command suffix=" switch" /> can be used non-interactively with arguments provided:

<CodeBlock className="sh">
  {`${CLI_BINARY} switch --region <REGION> --group <GROUP_NAME> <APP_ID>
${CLI_BINARY} deploy --prod`}
</CodeBlock>

In the command above, `<REGION>` is the region of the application<Conditional brand="leancloud">, which can be set to `cn-n1` (China North), `cn-e1` (China East), or `us-w1` (International)</Conditional>.
`--prod` means to deploy to the production environment. To deploy to the staging environment, use <Command suffix=" deploy --staging" />.
With the two commands mentioned above, you can write CI scripts to quickly deploy your project to multiple applications.

### Can I extend the features provided by the CLI?

If you have certain operations that need to be performed frequently (like checking the total number of records in `_User`), you can define your own commands.

Simply create an executable file with its name starting with `lean-` (like `lean-usercount`) and put it into a directory included in `PATH` or `.leancloud/bin` under the project directory. After this, you will be able to run the file with <Command suffix=" usercount" />. Compared to running `lean-usercount`, this method gives the program in the file the ability to access the environment variables related to each application.

For example, you can put the file below into a directory included in `PATH` (like `/usr/local/bin`):

```python
#! /bin/env python

import sys

import leancloud

app_id = os.environ['LEANCLOUD_APP_ID']
master_key = os.environ['LEANCLOUD_APP_MASTER_KEY']

leancloud.init(app_id, master_key=master_key)
print(leancloud.User.query.count())
```

Grant the file the permission to be executed by running `$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lean-usercount`, and then run <Command suffix=" usercount" /> under the project directory. Now you will see the total number of records in `_User`.

### What has been changed in the 1.0 version of the CLI?

In March 2022, we launched the 1.0 version of the CLI. Below are the breaking changes:

- When using <Command suffix=" deploy" />, you have to specify the environment you want to deploy your project to (`--prod` or `--staging`). The older version of the CLI will deploy your project to the production environment if you’re using the trial mode and to the staging environment if you’re using the standard mode.
- <Command suffix=" up" /> won’t fetch the server-side environment variables by default.
  You can add the `--fetch-env` option to have those environment variables fetched.
- Deleted <Command suffix=" cache" />. We recommend that you use the most advanced <Command suffix=" db" /> for accessing LeanCache and LeanDB.

### I’ve installed the older version of the CLI with `npm`. How do I upgrade to the latest version?

If you’ve installed the older version of the CLI with `npm`, please uninstall the CLI with `npm uninstall -g avoscloud-code leancloud-cli` to avoid any conflicts. You can also follow Homebrew’s instructions to run `brew link --overwrite lean-cli` to override the previous `lean` command.

Using the REST API, you can report data directly to TapDB without relying on the SDK.

## Report Events and Properties

Please refer to [Data Rules](/sdk/tapdb/sdk/data-spec#数据规则) for the format and meaning of data transfer.

If the Response Code is 200, it means the data was reported successfully, please check the event writing status further in the burial site management.

### FAQ

- If the subject of the current event is not a device or a user, device_id and user_id can be passed any fixed value.

- To ensure that events reported on the server side can also be analyzed using the device dimension, it is recommended to call the SDK's `GetDeviceID` interface on the client side to obtain a unique ID and report it to the App's server side.

## Special Type Report

### Online Number

Since the SDK can't push accurate online data, we provide a server-side online data push interface here. The game server can count the number of people online every 5 minutes and push it to TapDB through the interface, TapDB will summarize the data.

**Note: The online count is reported in json format, which is different from other common event reporting formats, please pay attention to the difference.**

<Conditional region='global'>

`POST` `https://se.tapdb.ap-sg.tapapis.com/tapdb/online`

</Conditional>

`Content-Type: application/json`

Request Content：

| Parameter | Type | Descriptions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| client_id | string | The game ClientID. |
| onlines | array | Multiple online data (up to 100) |
 
The structure of the onlines array is:

| Parameter | Type | Descriptions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| server | string | TapDB accepts data only once per natural 5 minutes for the same server. |
| online | number | Online number |
| timestamp | number | Timestamp (in seconds) of the current statistics. TapDB will perform data alignment according to the natural 5 min. |

Example：

```json
{
    "client_id":"ClientID",
    "onlines":[{
      "server":"s1",
      "online":123,
      "timestamp":1489739590
    },{
      "server":"s2",
      "online":188,
      "timestamp":1489739560
    }]
}
```

### Recharge Record

Since the SDK push may be inaccurate, it is recommended to use the server-side recharge push interface directly. Note that you need to stop the reporting of recharge information in the client SDK to prevent duplicate statistics.

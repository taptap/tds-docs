### Q: How to create an advertising plan?

A：Enter TapDB's ad page, click Ad Management, select New Ad Campaign in the upper right corner, select the ad platform, pay attention to the matching method, fill in the information, and generate the placement link.

### Q: What is IP Matching?

A："IP Matching" is used to check if the IP of the user when clicking on the ad is the same as the IP when opening the game, and is applicable to all ads. Custom ads can be created if no corresponding platform is found when creating a campaign.

### Q: What is Device Matching？

A：Device Matching is that TapDB and the ad platform have finished interfacing, and the ad platform will return the data of clicked ads to TapDB to match the new users by device information, which is very accurate, but it is only used in the ad platform that has finished interfacing with TapDB.

### Q: How to place IP matches and device matches?

IP Matching: When you add an ad, select the ad platform, the IP matching ad platform is marked, and the IP matching ad needs to fill in the download link, after generating the link, directly fill in the IP matching generated placement link into the landing page URL of the ad platform.

Device Matching: The callback link can be generated directly after filling in the corresponding parameters of Device Matching. The callback link can be filled in the third-party monitoring link (the name may be different) of the ad platform, and the URL of the landing page can be filled in the download address of the game itself.

### Q: What if I can't use TapDB links to place ads?

A：For example, if the domain name of the game is a.b.c, you need to resolve a.b.c to [l.tapdb.net](http://l.tapdb.net) in the form of CNAME, then if the connection given by TapDB is `https://l.tapdb.net/xxxx`, directly replace [l.tapdb.net](http://l.tapdb.net) with a.b.c, replace "https" with "http", and finally become `http://a.b.c/xxxx`, and use this link to deliver the advertisement.

### Q: Why does the ad match players from other systems?

A：There are possible reasons why ads are matched to players on other systems.

(1) The placement is on the web, and both iOS and Android users will be matched.

(2) If the link is placed on iOS, Android users (who can see the ad) may click on it and actively search for the app to download, and then they will be matched.

All types of properties can have "deduplicated number" as the analysis indicator. For numeric types, "Sum", "Mean", "Maximum" and "Minimum" can be used as the analysis indicator.

1. **Number of users:** Number of all users. 
2. **Deduplication:** The number of deduplicates for this property among all users.
3. **Sum:** The sum of the attribute among all users.
4. **Mean:** The arithmetic mean of this attribute over all users.
5. **Maximum:** The maximum value of this attribute among all users.
6. **Minimum:** The minimum value of this property among all users.

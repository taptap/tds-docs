The number of new users per day is a very popular metric in Internet products. There are many more in-depth analyses that can be done on this metric of new users, such as

- Analyzing the number of new users brought by different channels in order to optimize the placement strategy.
- Analyzing the retention and conversion of new users brought by different channels, so as to compare the quality of users brought by different channels.
- Analyzing the percentage of daily revenue contributed by different channels.

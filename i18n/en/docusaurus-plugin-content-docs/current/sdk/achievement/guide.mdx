This page shows you how to integrate the Achievements service into your game. The Achievements service is based on TDS Authentication (TDSUser). You can read more about this in **[TDS Authentication > Guide](/sdk/authentication/guide/)**.

## Install the SDK

Please make sure that you have already [created the game](/sdk/start/quickstart/#creating-a-game), [configured the project](/sdk/start/quickstart/#project-configuration), and [initialized the project](/sdk/start/quickstart/#initialization) according to the [TapSDK Quickstart](/sdk/start/quickstart/). Once you have completed these steps, you can proceed to add the `TapAchievement` module from the TapSDK downloaded from the [Downloads](/tap-download) page:

<MultiLang>

<CodeBlock className="json">
{`"dependencies":{
  ...
  // Achievements service
  "com.taptap.tds.achievement": "https://github.com/TapTap/TapAchievement-Unity.git#${sdkVersions.taptap.unity}",
}`}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock className="groovy">
{`repositories{  
    flatDir {  
        dirs 'libs'  
    }  
}  
dependencies {  
    ... 
    implementation (name:'TapAchievement_${sdkVersions.taptap.android}', ext:'aar') // TapTap Achievements service
}`}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock className="objectivec">
{`// Achievements service
TapAchievementResource.bundle
TapAchievementSDK.framework`}
</CodeBlock>

</MultiLang>

## Register Callbacks
The Achievements SDK has several callbacks that are triggered when the data is initialized, when the data cannot be initialized, and when there is a progress update. The data initialization callback is particularly important as it is required for the SDK to work properly. If the data cannot be initialized, please either prompt the user or try to initialize the data again at another time.

<MultiLang>

<>

**Prerequisite**

TapTap.Achievement depends on the `TapTap.Bootstrap` library.

**Namespace**

```cs
using TapTap.Achievement;
```

To register callbacks:

```cs
TapAchievement.RegisterCallback(IAchievementCallback callback);

private class AchievementCallback:IAchievementCallback
{
    public void OnAchievementSDKInitSuccess()
    {
        // The Achievement SDK is initialized
    }

    public void OnAchievementSDKInitFail(TapError errorCode)
    {
        if (errorCode != null)
        {
            // Failed to initialize the SDK
        }
    }

    public void OnAchievementStatusUpdate(TapAchievementBean bean, TapError errorCode)
    {
        if (errorCode != null)
        {
            // Failed to update achievements
            return;
        }

        if (bean != null)
        {
            // Achievements updated
        }
    }
}
```

</>
<>

```java
TapAchievement.registerCallback(new AchievementCallback() {
  @Override
  public void onAchievementSDKInitSuccess() {
    // Data loaded
  }

  @Override
  public void onAchievementSDKInitFail(AchievementException exception) {
    // Failed to load data; please try again
  }

  @Override
  public void onAchievementStatusUpdate(TapAchievementBean item, AchievementException exception) {
    if (exception != null) {
      // Failed to update achievements
      return;
    }
    if (item != null) {
      // item updated
    }
  }
});
```

</>
<>


```objectivec
[TapAchievement registerCallBack:self];

- (void)onAchievementSDKInitSuccess {
  // Data loaded
}

// Failed to initialize the SDK
- (void)onAchievementSDKInitFail:(nullable NSError *)error {
    // Failed to load data; please try again
}

// Achievements updated
- (void)onAchievementStatusUpdate:(nullable TapAchievementModel *)achievement failure:(nullable NSError *)error {
    if (error) {
       // Failed to update achievements
    } else {
      // achievement updated
    }
}
```

</>

</MultiLang>

## Initialize the Data
Since the Achievements service keeps track of the user’s achievement data locally, please make sure to **initialize the data when the user is logged in**. If the user switches to a different account, be sure to call the interface for initializing the data again. Failure to do so may result in the achievement data for different accounts being mixed up.

This step is asynchronous, which means that you should not proceed until you have received a successful callback.

<MultiLang>

```cs
TapAchievement.InitData();
```

```java
TapAchievement.initData();
```

```objectivec
[TapAchievement initData];
```

</MultiLang>

## Get All Achievements
You can get all achievements from either the local cache or the server. The local cache is refreshed when you successfully invoke the data initialization interface. It is also refreshed when you proactively invoke the data fetching interface.

If you need to fetch the latest data from the server while the player is playing, you can use the data fetching interface. Most of the time you just need to load the data from the local cache.

<MultiLang>

```cs
// Get local data
TapAchievement.GetLocalAllAchievementList((list, code) =>
{
     if (code != null)
     {
        // Failed to get all achievements
     }
     else
     {
        // Got all achievements successfully
     });
}
// Fetch data from the server
TapAchievement.FetchAllAchievementList((list, code) =>
{
     if (code != null)
     {
        // Failed to fetch all achievements
     }
     else
     {
        // Fetched all achievements successfully
     });
}
```

```java
// Local data
List<TapAchievementBean> allList = TapAchievement.getLocalAllAchievementList();

// Server data
TapAchievement.fetchAllAchievementList(new GetAchievementListCallBack() {
  @Override
  public void onGetAchievementList(List<TapAchievementBean> achievementList, AchievementException exception) {
    if (exception != null) {
      switch (exception.errorCode) {
        case AchievementException.SDK_NOT_INIT:
          // The SDK has not initialized the data yet
          break;
        default:
          // Failed to fetch data
      }
    } else {
      // Fetched data successfully
    }
  }
});
```

```objectivec
// Local data
 NSArray<TapAchievementModel *> *allList = [TapAchievement getLocalAllAchievementList];

 // Server data
 [TapAchievement fetchAllAchievementList:^(NSArray<TapAchievementModel *> *_Nullable result, NSError *_Nullable error) {
        if (error) {
            switch (error.code) {
                case 9001:
                    // The SDK has not initialized the data yet
                    break;
                default:
                    // Failed to fetch data
                    break;
            }
        } else {
            // Fetched data successfully
        }
    }];
```

</MultiLang>

## Get Current User’s Achievements
You can get the current user’s achievements from either the local cache or the server. The local cache is merged with the server data when you successfully invoke the data initialization interface (if different steps are tracked for the same achievement in the server and the local cache, the larger one is kept). They are also merged when you proactively invoke the data fetching interface.

The local data is often more accurate than the server data because the server data may be out of date due to previous synchronization failures.
<MultiLang>

```cs
// Get local data
TapAchievement.GetLocalUserAchievementList((list, code) =>
{
     if (code != null)
     {
        // Failed to get user’s achievements
     }
     else
     {
        // Got user’s achievements successfully
     });
}
// Fetch data from the server
TapAchievement.FetchUserAchievementList((list, code) =>
{
     if (code != null)
     {
        // Failed to fetch user’s achievements
     }
     else
     {
        // Fetched user’s achievements successfully
     });
}
```

```java
// Local data
List<TapAchievementBean> userList = TapAchievement.getLocalUserAchievementList();

// Server data
TapAchievement.fetchUserAchievementList(new GetAchievementListCallBack() {
  @Override
  public void onGetAchievementList(List<TapAchievementBean> achievementList, AchievementException exception) {
    if (exception != null) {
      switch (exception.errorCode) {
        case AchievementException.SDK_NOT_INIT:
          // The SDK has not initialized the data yet
          break;
        default:
          // Failed to fetch data
      }
    } else {
      // Fetched data successfully
    }
  }
});
```

```objectivec
// Local data
 NSArray<TapAchievementModel *> *userList = [TapAchievement getLocalUserAchievementList];

// Server data
[TapAchievement fetchUserAchievementList:^(NSArray<TapAchievementModel *> *_Nullable result, NSError *_Nullable error) {
        if (error) {
            switch (error.code) {
                case 9001:
                    // The SDK has not initialized the data yet
                    break;
                default:
                    // Failed to fetch data
                    break;
            }
        } else {
            // Fetched data successfully
        }
    }];
```

</MultiLang>

## Get an Achievement (Directly)

<MultiLang>

```cs
// displayID is the Achievement ID you configured on the Developer Center
TapAchievement.Reach("displayID");
```

```java
// displayID is the Achievement ID you configured on the Developer Center
TapAchievement.reach("displayID");
```

```objectivec
// displayID is the Achievement ID you configured on the Developer Center
[TapAchievement reach:@"displayId"];
```

</MultiLang>

## Add Steps to an Accumulation Achievement
There are two ways to add steps to an accumulation achievement. The first is to call `growSteps` with the number of steps to add (for example, enter `5` to add `5` steps). The second is to use `makeSteps` with the total number of steps (for example, enter `100` to set the total number of steps to `100`). Internally, the SDK would calculate the total number of steps when you call `growSteps`.

<MultiLang>

```cs
// displayID is the Achievement ID you configured on the Developer Center
TapAchievement.GrowSteps("displayID", step);
TapAchievement.MakeSteps("displayID", step);
```

```java
// displayID is the Achievement ID you configured on the Developer Center
TapAchievement.growSteps("displayID", 5);
TapAchievement.makeSteps("displayID", 100);
```

```objectivec
// displayID is the Achievement ID you configured on the Developer Center
[TapAchievement growSteps:@"displayID" numSteps:5];
[TapAchievement makeSteps:@"displayID" numSteps:100];
```

</MultiLang>

## Set Toasts
By default, the SDK automatically displays a toast when the player gets an achievement. You can turn off toasts using the following interface:

<MultiLang>

```cs
TapAchievement.SetShowToast(bool isShow);
```

```java
TapAchievement.setShowToast(false);
```

```objectivec
[TapAchievement setShowToast:NO];
```

</MultiLang>

## Show Achievements
The SDK comes with a page that shows all the achievements the player has gotten:

<MultiLang>

```cs
TapAchievement.ShowAchievementPage();
```

```java
TapAchievement.showAchievementPage();
```

```objectivec
[TapAchievement showAchievementPage];
```

</MultiLang>

## Interpreting Achievement Data

<MultiLang>

```cs
public string displayId;              // Achievement ID
public int visible = VisibleFalse;    // Whether the achievement is hidden
public string title;                  // Name
public string subTitle;               // Description
public string achieveIcon;            // Icon
public int step;                      // Total steps
public bool fullReached;              // Whether the player has gotten the achievement
public int reachedStep;               // Current steps
public long reachedTime;              // When the player has gotten the achievement
public AchievementStats stats;        // Rarity
```

```java
  /*base*/
  private String displayId;             // Achievement ID
  private int visible = VISIBLE_TRUE;   // Whether the achievement is hidden
  private String title;                 // Name
  private String subTitle;              // Description
  private String achieveIcon;           // Icon
  private int step;                     // Total steps
  private AchievementStats stats;       // Rarity
  private int type;                     // Type; 1 means basic achievement; 99 means Platinum Achievement
  /*user*/
  private boolean fullReached;          // Whether the player has gotten the achievement
  private int reachedStep;              // Current steps
  private long reachedTime;             // When the player has gotten the achievement
```

```objectivec
@property (nonatomic, copy, readonly) NSString *displayId;      // Achievement ID
@property (nonatomic, copy, readonly) NSString *achieveIcon;    // Icon
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *title;                    // Name
@property (nonatomic, copy, readonly) NSString *subTitle;       // Description
@property (nonatomic, assign, readonly) NSNumber *step;         // Total steps
@property (nonatomic, strong) TDSAchievementStatus *stats;      // Rarity
@property (nonatomic, assign) NSInteger type;                   // Type; 1 means basic achievement; 99 means Platinum Achievement

// User data
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL fullReached;                 // Whether the player has gotten the achievement
@property (nonatomic, assign) long reachedTime;                 // When the player has gotten the achievement
@property (nonatomic, assign) NSInteger reachedStep;            // Current steps
```

</MultiLang>

## Internationalization

The Achievements service supports multiple languages:

:::tip
When the data is initialized, only the achievement data for the current language is synchronized from the server. To switch to another language after initialization, call `fetchAllAchievementList` and `fetchUserAchievementList`.
:::

<Languages />

## REST API

Now let’s look at the REST API provided by the Achievements service.
You can write your own programs or scripts to invoke these interfaces to perform server-side administrative operations.

### Request Format

The body of any request sent to the REST API must be a JSON object. The `Content-Type` in the HTTP header should be `application/json`.

Requests sent to the server are authenticated using the key-value pairs in the HTTP Header:

Key|Value|Description
---|----|---
`X-TDS-Id`|`{{clientId}}`|The game’s `Client Id`, which can be found on the Developer Center.
`X-TDS-Server-Secret`|`{{serverSecret}}`|The game’s `Server Secret`, which can be found on the Developer Center.

Find out more about application credentials [here](/sdk/storage/guide/setup-dotnet#credentials).

In addition to providing the `Client Id` through the `X-TDS-Id` HTTP Header, you must also provide the same `Client Id` in the URL.

When obtaining achievements, you must specify the language in the URL. See [Language Codes](#language-codes) for more information.


If there is an error, the HTTP status code 500 will be returned, like:

```json
{
    "code": "500",
    "msg": "成就服务忙，稍后请求",
}
```

### Get All Achievements

Below is the interface for retrieving all the game’s achievements. Make sure you include the language in the URL.

```sh
curl -X GET \
  -H "X-TDS-Id: {{clientId}}" \
  -H "X-TDS-Server-Secret: {{serverSecret}}" \
  https://tds-tapsdk.cn.tapapis.com/achievement/open/v1/clients/{{clientId}}/achievements/languages/<lang>
```

The response body looks like this:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "list": [
      {
        "achievement_id": "Achievement ID",
        "client_id": "Client ID",
        "achievement_open_id": "Achievement open ID (a custom achievement ID specified by the developer when creating the achievement; this is the unique identifier used when submitting achievement data with the SDK)",

        },
        "achievement_rarity": {
          "rarity": "Rarity rate",
          "level": "Rarity; 1 means Common; 2 means Uncommon; 3 means Rare; 4 means Ultra Rare"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Get a User’s Achievements

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Submit Achievements

Below is the interface for submitting one or more achievements that a player has earned. The achievements submitted will be **added** to the list of achievements the player has already earned.

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-TDS-Id: {{clientId}}" \
  -H "X-TDS-Server-Secret: {{serverSecret}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

        [{
          "achievement_id": "Achievement ID",
          "achievement_open_id": "Achievement open ID (a custom achievement ID specified by the developer when creating the achievement; this is the unique identifier used when submitting achievement data with the SDK)",
          "complete_time": "Time of completion (in miliseconds)",
          "completed_step": "Steps completed"
        }]
      }]
    }' \
  https://tds-tapsdk.cn.tapapis.com/achievement/open/v1/clients/{{clientId}}/achievements
```

The response body looks like this:

            "code": "Is 0 if succeeded and the error code if not"
            "msg": "Is not included if succeeded and the error message if not"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Language Codes

The REST API accepts language codes defined by ISO 639-1. For example, `en` means English and `jp` means Japanese. There are a couple of exceptions:

1. For languages not included in ISO 639-1, the language codes defined in ISO 632-2 are used. For example, `fil` means Filipino.
2. When a language cannot be represented by a language code, the location code defined in ISO 3166-1 will be attached. For example, `zh_CN` means Simplified Chinese.

The following language codes are supported by the REST API:

| Code | Language         |
| ------- | ----------- |
| zh_CN    | Simplified Chinese     |
| zh_TW    | Traditional Chinese     |
| en_US    | English (US) |

| he       | Hebrew     |
| hu       | Hungarian     |
| is       | Icelandic       |
| it       | Italian     |
| lv       | Latvian   |

Keep in mind that some of the languages listed above are only supported by the REST API but [not the client SDK](#internationalization).


## Video Tutorials

You can refer to the video tutorial:[How to Integrate Achievements in Games](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1yH4y1z7F7/) to learn how to access achievements in Untiy projects.

For more video tutorials, see [Developer Academy](https://developer.taptap.cn/tds-tutorials/list). As the SDK features are constantly being improved, there may be inconsistencies between the video tutorials and the new SDK features, so the current documentation should prevail.

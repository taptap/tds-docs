## Overview

Gift Packages lets you create gift codes for your game which players can redeem in your game later.

### Capabilities

- With Gift Packages, you can quickly add a gift system to your game without having to write the low-level logic for it.
- Gift Packages comes with interfaces for redeeming gift codes, which players can access through your game or a website you build.

### Highlights

- You can create two types of gift codes with Gift Packages: unlimited codes and one-time codes. It’s up to you to decide which one to use for each event held in your game.
- You can customize the characters and redeeming rules of your gift codes, as well as the items players would get by redeeming the codes.
- Compared to setting up your own system, Gift Packages allows you to implement the same feature in your game with a lower cost spent on data storage. Gift Packages itself will also keep evolving to cater to the change in users’ requirements so you don’t have to do the work of constantly updating your system.
- You can monitor the statistics data to observe how your gift codes have been consumed since they got launched and learn about the outcomes of the events you held for your game.

## FAQ

Q: I see an error saying that the system cannot save the Client ID.

A: Please go to **Developer Center**→**Game Services**→**Configuration** and enable the service to obtain a Client ID.

Q: Why can’t I see the **Game Services** tab?

A: When the administrator of a provider adds a new user to the provider, the administrator needs to grant the user the permission to view a game’s configuration before the user can see the **Game Services** tab and the content within it.

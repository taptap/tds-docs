## Overview

Gift Packages allows you to create gift codes for your game and let players redeem the codes in your game.

### Capabilities

- With Gift Packages, you can add a gift system to your game within a single day without having to manually write the low-level logic for it.
- Gift Packages provides interfaces for redeeming gift codes, which players can access through your game or your website.

### Highlights

- Gift Packages comes with two types of gift codes: unlimited codes and one-time codes. It’s up to you to decide which one to use for each event held in your game.
- You can customize the content, redeeming rules, and items of your gift codes.
- Compared to setting up your own system, Gift Packages allows you to implement the same feature in your game with a lower cost of data storage. Gift Packages itself will keep evolving to cater to the change in users’ requirements so you don’t have to do the work of constantly updating your system.
- You can monitor the statistics data to learn about how your gift codes have been consumed since they got launched and understand the effectiveness of the events you held for your game.

## FAQ

Q: I see an error saying that the system cannot save the Client ID.

A: Please go to **Developer Center**→**Game Services**→**Configuration** and enable the service to obtain a Client ID.

Q: Why can’t I see the **Game Services** tab?

A: When the administrator of a provider adds a new user to the provider, they need to grant the user the permission to view a game’s configuration before the user can see the tab and the content in it.

Before integrating Gift Packages into your game, please first complete setting up your game. You can obtain the **Client ID and Server Secret** of your game on **Game Services - Configuration**. This information should be kept private and shall not be shared with other people.
:::

## Getting Started

You can only use Gift Packages with your game if your game is capable of making requests to our server. At this time, players cannot redeem gift codes without connecting to the internet.

You can use one of the following methods to complete the process of redeeming a gift code.

| Method           | API                           | The game needs to verify that players meet the conditions of claiming the gifts | The game needs to provide an interface for delivering items to players |

### Steps to Integrate Gift Packages Into Your Game

- Finish setting up the game and obtain the **Client ID and Server Secret**.
- Optional: Go to **Operational Tools - Gifts - Server Configuration** and configure a server that will be used to receive notifications and deliver items to players.
- Create gift events and export gift codes. Once you finish this step, you will be ready to test the gift codes.
- Players redeem your gift codes and obtain the items.

### Steps to Redeem a Gift Code

Below are the basic steps for redeeming a gift code:

1. Send the **gift code** and **other configuration data** to the interface for redeeming gift codes.
2. The interface will check if the data provided is valid.
3. The system will determine if **the game’s interface for secondary checks** needs to be invoked.
4. If all the checks have passed, the system will determine if **the game’s interface for delivering items to players** needs to be invoked.

There are three different types of interfaces for redeeming a gift code. You can integrate one of them into your game:

| Name         | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Verified by game   | Choose this flow if you plan to set up a server that connects to our system, are able to have your secrets securely stored, and wish to have your app verify if a request for redeeming a code should be allowed while having an interface provided by your game invoked to deliver the items to the player. |
| Requested by game   | Choose this flow if you plan to set up a server that connects to our system, are able to have your secrets securely stored, and wish to have an interface provided by your game invoked to deliver the items to the player. |
| Redeeming without a server | Choose this flow if you don’t want to build and maintain your own interface. Your game will be invoking an interface provided by our system and a value will be returned indicating whether the request succeeded. |

### Three Ways for Redeeming

#### Verified by Game

When your game sends a request to the `submit-check` interface for redeeming a gift code, the system will check the inventory as well as whether the submitted data is valid. If everything looks good, the system will invoke the URL you provided for secondary checks with the conditions you set up on the Developer Center as arguments.
If your interface approves the request, the system will invoke your interface for delivering items to the player with the items configured on the Developer Center.
![Verified by game](/img/tds-gift/submit_check.png)

#### Requested by Game

When your game sends a request to the `submit-send` interface for redeeming a gift code, the system will check the inventory as well as whether the submitted data is valid. If everything looks good, the system will invoke your interface for delivering items to the player with the items configured on the Developer Center.
![Requested by game](/img/tds-gift/submit_send.png)

#### Redeeming Without a Server

When your game sends a request to the `submit-simple` interface for redeeming a gift code, the system will check the inventory as well as whether the submitted data is valid. If everything looks good, the system will return the items configured on the Developer Center to you.
![Redeeming without a server](/img/tds-gift/submit_simple.png)

## Connecting to the Interface for Redeeming Items

### Implementing Secondary Checks With Your Game

If you have set up custom redeeming rules on the Developer Center and you’re redeeming a gift code with an interface that has the capability of performing secondary checks, the system will send the redeeming rules to your game for a secondary check. The configuration shown in the image below will trigger the following request to the interface you set up on the Developer Center:

![Custom redeeming rules](/img/tds-gift/custom_redemption.png)

```
curl --location -g --request POST <URL_FOR_SECONDARY_CHECK> \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"activity_id":<EVENT_ID>,"character_id":<USER_ID>,"content":"[{\"condition\":\"level\",\"operate":\"gt\",\"value\":10}]","ext":<THE_EXT_SUBMITTED>,"gift_code":<GIFT_CODE>,"nonce_str":"abcdc","server_code": <SERVER_CODE>,"sign":"42d2b58a8cd58b5e63d90524aaf63ef97e04f223","timestamp":1658825322}'
```

After verifying the request, please return a JSON containing the following fields to inform the system of the result.

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "errorCode": "An error code string"
}
```

You can use snake_case as well if you wish to maintain consistency.

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "error_code": "An error code string"
}
```

If you don’t need our system to know the specific error message, your interface can simply return a **non-200 HTTP code** to indicate that the redemption failed, or an **HTTP code 200** to indicate that the redemption succeeded.
This allows your interface to respond to requests without following the format specified above.

| Request parameter          | Type           | Description                 |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| activity_id       | String         | Event ID          |
| character_id      | String         | User ID        |
| content           | String (JSON) | Custom redeeming rules |
| content.condition | String         | Custom redeeming rules (condition)       |
| content.operate   | String         | Custom redeeming rules (comparison operator)      |
| content.value     | String         | Custom redeeming rules (value)     |
| ext               | String         | A value provided when sending a request to the interface |
| gift_code         | String         | The gift code entered by the user |
| nonce_str         | String         | A random string used for this request |
| server_code       | String         | Server code          |
| sign              | String         | Signature                 |
| timestamp         | Number           | Timestamp with a second precision           |

| Response parameter  | Type           | Description                                            |
| --------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| errorCode | String        | Error type; same as `error_code`; if both of them exist, `errorCode` will be used |
| ext       | String (optional) | A string passed to the interface for delivering items to the player                  |
| status    | Boolean         | Whether the request passed the verification; `true` means yes and `false` means no         |

### Delivering Items to Players

After validation is completed, our system will send a request to **the game’s interface for delivering items to players** with the items configured on the Developer Center as well as the configured parameters. The configuration shown in the image below will trigger the following request to the interface you set up on the Developer Center:
![Custom redeeming rules](/img/tds-gift/custom_prizes.png)

```
curl --location -g --request POST <URL_FOR_ITEM_DELIVERY> \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"activity_id": <EVENT_ID>,"character_id":"uid","content":"[{\"name\": \"ITEM_NAME\", \"number\": 2}]","ext":<THE_EXT_SUBMITTED>,"gift_code":"gift_code","nonce_str":"abcdc","server_code":<SERVER_CODE>,"sign":"fbe23e6f6f5193355b29e9ea2913b1992af56346","check_ext":<RETURNED_EXT>,"timestamp":1658827492}'
```

After completing the request, please return a JSON containing the following fields to inform the system of the result. You can use snake_case as well if you wish to maintain consistency.

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "errorCode": "An error code string"
}
```

If you don’t need our system to know the specific error message, your interface can simply return a **non-200 HTTP code** to indicate that the redemption failed, or an **HTTP code 200** to indicate that the redemption succeeded.
This allows your interface to respond to requests without following the format specified above.

| Request parameter       | Type           | Description                         |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| activity_id    | String         | Event ID                  |
| character_id   | String         | User ID                |
| server_code    | String         | Server code                  |
| content        | String (JSON) | Custom items set up on the Developer Center         |
| content.name   | String         | Item name                     |
| content.number | Number           | Item count                     |
| ext            | String         | A value provided when sending a request to the interface         |
| gift_code      | String         | The gift code entered by the user         |
| nonce_str      | String         | A random string used for this request         |
| sign           | String         | Signature                         |
| check_ext      | String         | The string provided by the interface that does secondary checks |
| timestamp      | Number           | Timestamp with a second precision                   |

| Response parameter  | Type   | Description                                            |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| errorCode | String | Error type; same as `error_code`; if both of them exist, `errorCode` will be used |
| status    | Boolean | Whether the request succeeded; `true` means yes and `false` means no         |

### Redeeming Without a Server

With this method, you don’t have to implement an interface for validating requests and delivering items yourself.

If you choose to use this method, make sure to **specify that the event doesn’t need a server when creating the event on the Developer Center**.

Our system will provide the redemption result upon receiving a request. Your game will then determine whether to give the items to the player depending on the result.

### Request Domain

| TapTap edition     | Domain                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| China (taptap.com) | https://poster-api.xd.cn  |
| Other countries and regions (taptap.io)  | https://poster-api.xd.com |

### Signature

For security reasons, when your game communicates with our system, it needs to provide a signature in each request. **The “Secret” mentioned below refers to the Server Secret found on Game Services > Configuration on the Developer Center**.

:::tip
To ensure the highest security, please never use the Server Secret of your game on the client side.
:::

Pseudo-code for obtaining a signature:

```
sign == sha1(timestamp + nonce_str + secret)
```

You can check if the process of obtaining signatures is implemented correctly with the help of unit testing. The code below is an example in golang:

```go
func TestMakeSign(t *testing.T) {
    timestamp := 1655724586
    nonceStr := "abcde"
    secret := "abc"
    sign := MakeSign(int64(timestamp), nonceStr, secret)
    assert.Equal(t, sign, "3cb8c38833fa742e7873378faddcbe5b56088482")
    //output: 3cb8c38833fa742e7873378faddcbe5b56088482
}
```

To ensure that the Secret never appears on the client side, when redeeming without a server, the signature can be generated **with the Client ID instead of the Secret**.

```
sign == sha1(timestamp + nonce_str + client_id)
```

### Using the Redemption Interface on a Web Page

Our system provides a simple interface for redeeming gift codes that supports CAPTCHA. If you have a web page for your event, you can embed this interface into the web page. This interface shares the same flow as those introduced earlier. The only difference is that some of the parameters have been changed.

#### Getting a CAPTCHA

:::tip
Each CAPTCHA is only valid for 5 minutes. You can request a new CAPTCHA if one expires.
:::

GET /api/v1.0/cdk/page/captcha-img

Q: I’ve provided all the required parameters but I still got a 403 error.

A: Please check if a special User Agent has been included in the request’s header.

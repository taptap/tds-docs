## Features

### Real-Time Voice Conversation

RTC allows up to 6 people to talk at the same time and transmits data with ultra-low latency. It is ideal for multiplayer team hacking and other competitive gaming scenarios. RTC also supports:

- Blocking the voice of others in the room
- Event callbacks for members who enter the room and speak, which the game can use to determine player status
- Enabling/disabling loopback

### Voice Compliance

RTC supports filtering of illegal content in English and Chinese. The game can report the voice to the compliance module in different slice lengths. If a violation is detected, the game will receive a callback, and the game can decide whether to kick the player out of the room, ban them, or take no action at all.
Note: Currently, language compliance only supports Mandarin and a few dialects. Other languages will be supported in future versions.

### 3D Voice

3D Voice can convert the sound without orientation into the sound with orientation, which gives the player the feeling that the sound is coming from one place in the room, suitable for creating an immersive listening experience for battle royale, FPS, and other games.

   1. Set the voice slice length: A shorter slice length sacrifices some of the contextual semantics for a relatively fast callback speed. You can choose the slice length according to your actual scenario;
   2. Set the callback address: The callback address for receiving speech compliance recognition results;

5. Download the TapSDK (minimum supported version is v3.5.0) and integrate it into the game package;

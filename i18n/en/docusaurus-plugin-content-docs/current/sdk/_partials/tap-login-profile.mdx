`Profile` will contain the following info:

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`    | The player's nickname on TapTap.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `avatar`  | The URL of the player's profile picture on TapTap.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `openid`  | A **unique identifier** generated from the user's profile and the game's information. Each player has a unique `openid` in each game.                                                                    |
| `unionid` | A unique identifier generated from the user's profile and the vendor's information. A player has the same `unionid` for all the games made by the same vendor, but different ones for different vendors. |

`openid` and `unionid` are Base64-encoded strings (with padding) containing characters from `A-Za-z0-9+/=`.

:::info
Since `unionid` is strongly associated with the vendor, if your game gets transferred to a different vendor, the `unionid` of the users will get changed.

If your game depends on `unionid`, our technical support staff will have a discussion with you regarding how the data should be handled so the game will still work properly after being transferred.

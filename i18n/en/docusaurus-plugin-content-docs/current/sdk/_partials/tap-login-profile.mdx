</Conditional>

`openid` and `unionid` are Base64-encoded strings (with padding) containing characters from `A-Za-z0-9+/=`.

:::info
Since `unionid` is strongly associated with the vendor, if your game gets transferred to a different vendor, the `unionid` of the users will get changed.

If your game depends on `unionid`, our technical support staff will have a discussion with you regarding how the data should be handled so the game will still work properly after being transferred.

### Frequently Asked Questions and Guidelines

### Explanation of the Payroll programme affiliation period

- Games joining the Payroll programme have a default partnership period of 3 months, and are automatically renewed at the end of the partnership period, with each renewal lasting 1 natural month.
- After 1 month of joining the Payroll programme, the developer can cancel the automatic renewal of the contract. After the automatic renewal has been cancelled, the contract will reach the end of the cooperation period and the Payroll cooperation will end. If you need to terminate the Payroll cooperation immediately, please contact Customer Service via the work order to process it.
- If you have cancelled the auto-renewal contract, you can reopen the payroll plan, and once reopened, the payroll plan will take effect the next day.


### Strategy for using TDS free services

- During the cooperation period of the Firework Programme, developers can use the paid services of TDS free of charge (except the SMS service) and can use them directly after the normal access. If the platform finds that the game is suspected of violating the law, the TapTap platform has the right to immediately terminate the rights and benefits.
- Consult the appropriate service through the work order, our technical support colleagues will provide you with a full range of services.

### Tips for using the Extra Exposure benefits of the Salary Fire Plan

- After joining the Salary Plan, you can immediately receive 3 times the Extra Exposure Traffic Benefits and you can use the Accelerated Benefits up to 2 times in the same natural month;
- How do I use the benefits after receiving them?
  - The current number of times the rights are available is displayed in real time on the details page of the PayFlame programme. Click on "Use traffic rights" to configure the traffic plan.
  - After confirming the usage, the traffic right will be considered as "Used" and the system will return the usage result after 72 hours.
  - The system will return the usage result after 72 hours. If the rights are successfully used and take effect, the exposure volume will be counted; if the rights do not take effect within 72 hours, they will automatically be restored and developers can use them again.
- When can I use exposure rights to get better results?
  - The additional exposure rights are based on the original exposure weight of the game and are reasonably weighted to increase the exposure weight, so if the game itself has a high base traffic, you can get better results. It is recommended that you use them for game launches, major version updates and major operational activity.

### What about suspected irregularities?

#### Non-compliance includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviour

- The game is on a non-TapTap app platform;
- The same game ID used to join the payroll is used to access the services of multiple games;
- The content of the game violates any applicable laws and regulations;

#### What are the implications of suspected irregularities?

- If a game is suspected of non-compliance, the TapTap platform will immediately terminate the rights and benefits, including TDS free game services and additional traffic rights. If the corrective actions are not completed within 14 working days, the right to use the TDS free service will be deactivated, and the costs incurred during and after the processing cycle will be borne by the developer, and at the same time, the game will be removed from the shelves and hidden from view, and the responsibility will be pursued in accordance with the contents of the "**TapTap Platform Fuel Plan Service Agreement**".

#### How to rectify suspected irregularities?

- If your game is suspected of being shelved on other platforms, please contact the staff of the corresponding platform as soon as possible to have your game shelved.
- If you are using the TDS free service in violation of the law, please stop using the service immediately.

According to XD’s financial report in 2021, the MAU of the TapTap international version has grown to 12.24 million, and it still maintains a high growth rate. Based on tens of millions of MAUs, in addition to the basic distribution capabilities, TapTap has the ability to provide more platform-based one-stop services for domestic developers going overseas. For example, "bonfire testing" or "beta testing" can help developers acquire seed users and provide a sufficient and diverse population for each level of testing. Users help developers tune the game through the mechanism of community feedback and grow in testing. For global testing, developers generally cannot easily open Google and iOS stores in key countries such as the United States, Germany and France during the testing period. Only some small-volume countries such as the Philippines, Canada, etc. can be opened for testing. With the help of TapTap, we can introduce more users from core countries, especially users in Tier-1 countries. The number of users in TapTap international is quite stable, which help developer solve the problem of user volume during the test period. In global testing process, advertising purchases are often limited by the insufficient cold start speed and the small purchase area. It is difficult to import sufficient number of users on the test day or the next day.

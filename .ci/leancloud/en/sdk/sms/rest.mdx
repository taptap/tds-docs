[REST API](/sdk/storage/guide/rest/) 可以让任何支持发送 HTTP 请求的设备与 LeanCloud 进行交互。使用我们的短信服务 REST API 可以完成很多事情，比如：

The current API version is `1.1`.
For request format and response format, please refer to the [Request Format section](/sdk/storage/guide/rest/#请求格式) and [Response Format section](/sdk/storage/guide/rest/#响应格式) of REST API Guide.

Sending SMS verification code involves three parties: client side, cloud side (LeanCloud), and mobile network operator:

## Configure SMS Service

To be able to send text messages to users of your application, you need to first [finish some initial configurations](/sdk/sms/guide/#开通短信服务).

## General Verification API

It is becoming quite common that apps rely on SMS to perform verification for sensitive operations.

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mobilePhoneNumber": "+1xxxxxxxxxx"}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/requestSmsCode
```

| Parameter              |  Required  | Description                            |
| :---------------- | :--: | :----------------------------- |
| mobilePhoneNumber | Required | mobile phone number                         |
| smsType           | Optional | `voice` or `sms` (default value: `sms`) |
| ttl               | Optional | verification code valid time in minutes (default value: `10`) |
| name              | Optional | application name |
| op                | Optional | operation name, e.g. payment |
| template          | Optional | template name, see [Templates section](#templates) below |
| validate_token    | Optional | see [CAPTCHA section](#CAPTCHA) below | 
| other_variable    | Optional | [template variable](#templates), `other_variable` is just an example variable name |

It will return status code `200 OK` if succeeded.

Once the user receives the short message, they can fill in the verification code in your application.
Then you can send a `POST` request to `/verifySmsCode` to check if the code is valid.

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mobilePhoneNumber":"+1xxxxxxxxxx"}' \
  "https://{{host}}/1.1/verifySmsCode/123456"
```

`123456` is the verification code.

It will return status code `200 OK` if succeeded.

### Sending Verification Code by Calling

You can specify the value of `smsType` parameter as `voice` to send the verification code via phone call.
The phone call will only tell the verification code to the user.
You cannot send other information to users in this way.

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mobilePhoneNumber": "+1xxxxxxxxxx", "smsType":"voice"}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/requestSmsCode
```

### Templates

Besides the default verification short message, you can use templates to customize verification message content, or send other non-verification messages, such as notification messages.

Refer to [the Templates section of Short Message Service (SMS) Guide](/sdk/sms/guide/) for information about how to create a template.

To use SMS templates, pass the `template` parameter to `requestSmsCode`:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mobilePhoneNumber": "+1xxxxxxxxxx", "template":"Order_Notice", "date":"31 Oct. 2014"}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/requestSmsCode
```

`date` is a template variable.

## User Verification API

LeanCloud offers a built-in [user system](/sdk/sms/guide/#templates) for you to quickly implement account related features.
LeanCloud also provides dedicated SMS APIs to work with the user system.

### Signing up with Phones

It is common to ask users to sign up a new account directly with their phone numbers.
After acquiring a verification code via `POST /requestSmsCode` mentioned above,
your application can sign up a new user with the mobile phone number and the verification code:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mobilePhoneNumber":"+1xxxxxxxxxx","smsCode":"123456"}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/usersByMobilePhone
```

If the user (mobile phone) already exists, no new user will be created, and the API call will still be considered as a success.

If succeed, the response body will be something like:

```json
{
  "username":     "+1xxxxxxxxxx",
  "mobilePhone":  "+1xxxxxxxxxx",
  "createdAt":    "2014-11-07T20:58:34.448Z",
  "updatedAt":    "2014-11-07T20:58:34.448Z",
  "objectId":     "51c3ba66e4b0f0e851c1621b",
  "sessionToken": "pnktnjyb996sj4p156gjtp4im",
  "mobilePhoneVerified": true,
  // ... other
}
```

If the above call will create a new user account,
LeanCloud will set `mobilePhoneVerified` to `true`, set `username` to the mobile phone number, and generate a null password.
A null password indicates the user cannot log in via password.

To specify a username other than the mobile phone number, you can pass an additional `username` parameter.
Similarly, to allow the user to login via password later, you can pass an additional `password` parameter:


```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mobilePhoneNumber":"+1xxxxxxxxxx","smsCode":"123456", "password":"your-password"}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/usersByMobilePhone
```

`username` and `password` parameters only have effects when a new user will be created.
They will be ignored when logging in an existing user.

### Verifying Mobile Phone

As mentioned above, registering a new user with a mobile phone will set `mobilePhoneVerified` to `true`.
If the user is registered with another method, you can also ask the user to verify their phone:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mobilePhoneNumber": "+1xxxxxxxxxx"}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/requestMobilePhoneVerify
```

It will return status code `200 OK` if succeeded,
and LeanCloud will send the verification code to the user.
After the user receives the code, you can ask the user to submit it in your application,
and check its validness against LeanCloud via `POST /verifyMobilePhone/<code>`:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mobilePhoneNumber":"+1xxxxxxxxxx"}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/verifyMobilePhone/123456
```

If the verification succeeded, LeanCloud will set this user's `mobilePhoneNumberVerified` to `true`, and the response body will be something like:

```json
{
  "updatedAt":"2017-03-30T08:20:25.452Z",
  "objectId":"587a0f0661ff4b0065f1dff8"
}
```

If you want to make binding/changing mobile phone number an atomic operation, you can use `POST /requestChangePhoneNumber` and `POST /changePhoneNumber` instead:


```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Session: <sessionToken>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mobilePhoneNumber":"+1xxxxxxxxxx","ttl":10}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/requestChangePhoneNumber

curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mobilePhoneNumber":"+1xxxxxxxxxx","code":"123456"}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/changePhoneNumber
```

`"ttl": 10` means the verification code will be valid for 10 minutes.
It is optional (defaults to 6 minutes).

### Logging in with Phones

To log in an existing user with a verified mobile phone number, there is a dedicated endpoint (`POST /requestLoginSmsCode`) to request a verification code:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mobilePhoneNumber":"+1xxxxxxxxxx"}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/requestLoginSmsCode
```

It will return status code `200 OK` if succeeded.
Now this user can use their mobile phone number and verification code to log in:

```sh
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
-H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
-d '{"mobilePhoneNumber":"+1xxxxxxxxxx","smsCode":"123456"}' \
https://{{host}}/1.1/login
```

As mentioned above, calling `POST /requestSmsCode` and then `POST /usersByMobilePhone` can also log in an existing user.
However, calling `POST /requestLoginSmsCode` and then `POST /login` is preferred if you do not want to create a new user when the user does not exist.
This helps to prevent issues such as a user mistakenly inputs a wrong mobile phone number.

### Password Reset with Phone

A user with a verified mobile phone number can reset their password via their mobile phone:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mobilePhoneNumber": "+1xxxxxxxxxx"}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/requestPasswordResetBySmsCode
```

It will return status code `200 OK` if succeeded.

After the user fill in the received verification code, you can call `PUT /1.1/resetPasswordBySmsCode/<code>` to reset their password:

```sh
curl -X PUT \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"password": "<new password>", "mobilePhoneNumber": "+1xxxxxxxxxx"}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/resetPasswordBySmsCode/123456
```

## CAPTCHA

LeanCloud provides [CAPTCHA service](/sdk/sms/guide/##preventing-abuse-with-captcha) to prevent SMS abusing.

|URL|HTTP Method|Description|
| :----------------------------------- | :--- | ----------------- |
|/1.1/requestCaptcha|GET|get CAPTCHA image|
|/1.1/verifyCaptcha|POST|get token after verified|

After enabling CAPTCHA service on dashboard (refer to [SMS Guide](/sdk/sms/guide/) for instructions), you can request a CAPTCHA image as below:

```sh
curl -X GET \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
   -G \
  --data-urlencode 'size=4' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/requestCaptcha
```


Response:

```json
{
   "captcha_token":"R2cxkqSz",
   "captcha_url":"https:\/\/leancloud.cn\/1.1\/captchaImage?appId=PXnN5AqVpgEI4esrTLhoxUkd-gzGzoHsz&token=R2cxkqSz"
}
```

|Properties|Description|
|:----|:--|
|captcha_token|to be consumed by `POST /verifyCaptcha`|
|captcha_url|url to CAPTCHA image file|

Then you can verify it via:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "captcha_code": "0000",
        "captcha_token": "R2cxkqSz"
      }' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/verifyCaptcha

```

|Properties|Description|
| :----| :--|
|captcha_code|entered by the user|
|captcha_token|returned by `GET /requestCaptcha`|

If succeed, the response body will be:

```json
{ "validate_token": "the token to send SMS"}
```

The acquired  `validate_token` should be passed in the `POST /requestSmsCode` request：

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-LC-Id: {{appid}}" \
  -H "X-LC-Key: {{appkey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mobilePhoneNumber": "+1xxxxxxxxxx","validate_token":"token"}' \
  https://{{host}}/1.1/requestSmsCode
```

:::info
The PHP SDK is a server-side SDK primarily used to invoke management interfaces and cloud functions in trusted server environments like a cloud engine. If you need to use the PHP SDK on your own server, please refer to this documentation for the configuration process.

## Installing SDK

There are several ways for you to install our SDK and the most convenient one is to use a package manager.

### Installing with Package Manager

Composer is a recommended PHP package management tool. To install the SDK, simply execute the following command:

```sh
composer require leancloud/leancloud-sdk
```

### Installing Manually

 [PHP SDK ](https://releases.leanapp.cn/#/leancloud/php-sdk/releases)。

## Initializing Your Project


<AppConfig />

Then import  `Client` and call `initialize` to initialize it:

<Conditional brand="leancloud">

```php
use \LeanCloud\Client;
// 参数依次为 App ID、App Key、Master Key
Client::initialize("your-app-id", "your-app-key", "your-master-key");
```

</Conditional>

<Conditional brand="tds">

```php
use \LeanCloud\Client;
// 参数依次为 Client ID、Client Token、Server Secret
Client::initialize("your-Client-id", "your-client-token", "your-server-secret");
```

</Conditional>


## Enabling Debug Logs

You can easily trace the problems in your project by turning debug logs on during the development phase. Once enabled, details of every request made by the SDK along with errors will be output to IDE, browser console, or your app's Dashboard > LeanEngine > App logs.

```php
// Place the line after Client::initialize(); only needs to be called once
Client::setDebug(true)
```

Make sure debug logs are turned off before your app is published. Failure to do so may lead to the exposure of sensitive data.

## Verifying

First of all, make sure you are able to connect to LeanCloud server. You can test it by running the following command:

```sh
curl "https://{{host}}/1.1/date"
```

If everything goes well, it will return the current date:

```json
{ "__type": "Date", "iso": "2020-10-12T06:46:56.000Z" }
```

Then add the following code into your project:

```php
$testObject = new LeanObject("TestObject");
$testObject->set("words", "Hello world!");
try {
    $testObject->save();
    echo "Object saved.";
} catch (Exception $ex) {
    echo "An error occurred.";
}
```


Save and run your program.

Then go to **<Path to="storage" /> > Data > `TestObject`**. If you see a row with its `words` column being `Hello world!`, it means that you have correctly installed the SDK.

See [Debugging](#Debugging) if you’re not seeing the content.

## Debugging

This guide is written for the latest version of our SDK. If you encounter any error, please first make sure you have the latest version installed.


### `401 Unauthorized`

If you get a 401 error or see the following content in network logs:

```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "error": "Unauthorized."
}
```

It means that the App ID or App Key might be incorrect or don't match. If you have multiple apps, you might have used the App ID of one app with the App Key of another one, which will lead to such error.

### Client Cannot Access the Internet

Make sure you have granted enough permissions for your mobile app.

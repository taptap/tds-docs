## Create a Game Page in Developer Center

1. Go to <Blue>Developer Center</Blue>, click <Blue>Create Game</Blue> on the left, and fill in the information according to your own needs.  

    Attention  

    - After created, the game’s default status will be ‘To Be Released’. To release your game on TapTap, you will need to go to ‘Apply for Release’ to submit it for review by TapTap.  

    - When your game is ‘To Be Released’, some features such as ‘Store’ and ‘User System’ are available. But you will not be able to access any operation features yet.

    - When your game is ‘To Be Released’, you may upload the APK first. Some game services are only available after an APK is uploaded. Contact us if you have any questions about uploading package files.   

    - The upper limit for games to be released is 10\. You will not be able to create a new game when you have reached the limit.    

2. If you wish to delete a game, you may go to <Blue>All Games</Blue> and find ![‘deleteadmin’](https://img.tapimg.com/market/images/2e5c836549d866d6d44036d158095cbb.png) in the right corner.

## What are the differences between registered developer and verified developer?

- **Registered Developer**
  - Your account will be marked as 'Registered Developer' in **<Blue>Provider Settings</Blue>** of your developer page in Developer Center. Registered information can be modified and it will be automatically approved after submitted for review. If you would like to become a verified developer, you can start the process by clicking on 'Become A Verified Developer'.
  - Registered developers only have the provider's permissions such as publisher settings, permission management, and tickets, as well as permissions related to game operation such as releasing games, accessing data overview, submitting qualification documents, etc.
- **Verified Developer**
  - Your account will be marked as 'Verified Developer' in **<Blue>Provider Settings</Blue>** of your developer page in Developer Center. Registered information can be modified and submitted changes will need to be reviewed.
  - In addition to provider's permissions such as publisher settings, permission management, and tickets, as well as permissions related to game operation such as releasing games, accessing data overview, submitting qualification documents, etc; verified developers also have finance permissions such as setting up financial entity and game service billing, and access to game service such as TDS technical services and data analysis.

When you are a registered developer and need to release paid games on TapTap, after choosing to add provider's financial entity information, you will be redirected to the page for 'becoming a verified developer'.

When you need to enable some game services function on the developer page, after clicking on **<Blue>configuration</Blue>**, you will also be redirected to the page for becoming a verified developer.

## Submit For Review

After the application for verified developer is submitted, the TapTap operation team is expected to complete the review in 2 business days. The result will be available in **<Blue>Notifications</Blue>** of your account.

You can also view the review status on the application page:

- If the status is 'Under review', the page cannot be resubmitted. Please wait for the review result.
- If the status shows 'Rejected', please refer to the reason for rejection to revise the application and resubmit for review.

## Developer Page

Once your developer account has been approved, you can go to Developer Center **<Blue>Developer Center</Blue>** to access your developer page.

We would recomend you to use a title of a team as the provider title instead of your own name.

You can also send your request to our team at [international_operation@taptap.com](mailto:international_operation@taptap.com) and provide a scanned copy of the business license or other materials that can prove that you are an employee if the provider.

### Do I have to start uploading games immediately after I have registered successfully?

No.

TapTap does not have requirements on the time to creat game, so feel free to set up the game according to your own schedules. We do recommend you to upload the games as early as possible to get better prepared for the release.

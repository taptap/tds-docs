## Role Configuration  
 
### View authority of default roles

In <Blue>Authority Management</Blue> >> <Blue> Role Configuration</Blue>, there is a set of default roles that are commonly used such as developer, publisher and the game’s administrator. The authorities of default roles can be found in ‘View Role’ and cannot be changed.

### Add Roles

There might be some inconvenience in the actual work as the authority of default roles cannot be changed. In this case, go to <Blue>Add Role</Blue> and find two types of roles: the <Blue>Game’s Role</Blue> that deals with one specific game and the <Blue>Provider’s Role</Blue> that deals with multiple games of the same provider. After adding a new role, Master Administrator may name the role and select the authority according to the actual needs.

## Role Configuration for Members  

### Provider’s Authority

A member can obtain the provider’s authorities when necessary. For example, while provider administrator may manage the release and update of the game, members of finance role may focus on the orders, settlement, and reconciliation, etc. 

Go to <Blue>Authority Management</Blue> >> Select user >> Click on <Blue>Edit Authority</Blue> to set up this user’s authority.

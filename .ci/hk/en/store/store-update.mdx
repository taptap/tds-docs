## Q&A

### Can I change the title of the game? 

Yes.

You can also edit the game’s name and other information in the Update Game and submit the changes for review. Remember to change the game’s icon, promotion image, screenshots and other related materials accordingly. The new title of your game needs to be consistent with the title on any relevant legal documents. If you have updated the license of your game and it involves other IP, you will need to provide valid and complete proof of authorization.

Don’t forget to inform your players about the change and explain the reason in Notes or the Group. Confused users may leave negative reviews.

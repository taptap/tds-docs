## Q&A

### Can the game title be changed?

Yes.

When changing game name, you will also need to change the relevant assets such as icon, posters, screenshots and other materials and submit them for review.

After the game title has been changed, we recommend you to post an announcement on TapTap where you explain to the players the reason for the change to avoid confusion or the rating.

### Can I change the name of the package files?

Yes, but it is not recommended.

Changes of the package file name will cause the players to lose the data and have to re-install the game. If you are sure that you need to change the package name, we recommend that you post an announcement on TapTap to explain the situation to the players. And you will need to sent your request via ticket at **<blue>Developer Center</blue>** >> **<blue>Support</blue>** . Or you can contact our team at [international_operation@taptap.com](mailto:international_operation@taptap.com) .

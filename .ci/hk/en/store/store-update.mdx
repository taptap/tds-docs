### Location

You can schedule the release time for the update in the **<Blue>Release Settings</Blue>**.

- If you select **<Blue>Release Now</Blue>** in Release Settings, the new version of the information/APK will be updated to the game page immediately after passing the review.
- If you select **<Blue>Scheduled</Blue>** , the new version of the information/APK will be updated to the game page at the decided time after it passed the review.

Please note that you will need to set the time to at least 24 hours after the current time.

### Drafts

When creating a new version, you can submit the filled information immediately for review, or you can save it as a draft.

- After saving the draft, it will be loaded automatically when you open the page again.

## Q&A

### Can the game title be changed?

Yes.

When changing game name, you will also need to change the relevant assets such as icon, posters, screenshots and other materials and submit them for review.

After the game title has been changed, we recommend you to post an announcement on TapTap where you explain to the players the reason for the change to avoid confusion or the rating.

### Can I change the name of the package files?

Yes, but it is not recommended.

Changes of the package file name will cause the players to lose the data and have to re-install the game. If you are sure that you need to change the package name, we recommend that you post an announcement on TapTap to explain the situation to the players. And you will need to sent your request via ticket at **<Blue>Developer Center</Blue>** >> **<Blue>Support</Blue>**. Or you can contact our team at [international_operation@taptap.com](mailto:international_operation@taptap.com).

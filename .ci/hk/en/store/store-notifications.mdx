TapTap will trigger automatic notifications based on the developer's operational behavior. Currently, the platform sends automatic notifications based on the following scenarios. Developers can independently configure whether to receive notifications according to their actual needs.

- Regarding sending objects: Currently, the platform notifications are mainly directed to the roles of super administrators and game master administrators, etc. Developers can go to the backstage <Blue>Manage Permissions</Blue> module to configure the required roles independently.
- About sending forms: Now the platform supports sending forms such as email and in-site messages. Developers can go to the background <Blue>Message Center-Reception Settings</Blue> module to manage the relevant contact information.

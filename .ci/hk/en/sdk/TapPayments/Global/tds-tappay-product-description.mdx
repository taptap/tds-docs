## In-app purchases

### Product type

You can use TapTap Payments to sell non-subscription items that require one-time purchases inside the game, including:

* Consumable items: refer to items consumed by users to obtain game content, usually to help players progress through the game faster. Items need to be purchased again after being consumed. For example, game currency, game props, etc. When the user consumes goods, you need to allocate associated benefits or effects.
* Non-consumable items: refer to one-time purchases that will never expire. Users can permanently own the goods after purchase. For example, additional game levels in the game, unlimited premium members, game skins or equipment, etc.

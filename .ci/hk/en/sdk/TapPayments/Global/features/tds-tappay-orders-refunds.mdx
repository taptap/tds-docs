## Process refunds

In order to protect and safeguard the reasonable rights and interests of users, TapTap provides refund services for users. When a user initiates a refund request to TapTap, TapTap will collect materials from developers on the user's payments and item consumption for decision making on whether to allow a refund. You can view the refund requests submitted by users in "Game Services" - "TapTap Payments" - "Process Refunds":

* __Refund__: Agree to fully refund the user through TapTap. The system will refund the full amount paid by the user to the user's payment account. After the refund, you are responsible for informing the user how to handle the in-game items. 

* __Reject__: Do not agree to refund the user through TapTap. You must explain the reasonable reasons for not approving the refund to TapTap and the user, or provide evidence that the user has consumed relevant items.

If the developer is unresponsive or fails to handle the request, TapTap reserves the right to make the final decision.

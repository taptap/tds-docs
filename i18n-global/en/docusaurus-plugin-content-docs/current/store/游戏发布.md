## Select the region for the release

TapTap wants to build a community for players and developers around the world. It may be a huge step, but we encourage you to release your game on the global market.

If you need to select the region where your game is available for download, go to your game’s page in Developer Center, click on <Blue>Store</Blue> and edit the regions in <Blue>Store Settings</Blue>. 

Your game will only be available for download in the regions that you have selected. Users in other regions can still view this game on TapTap, but the page will only show information such as the title, developer and the cover image. Users will be able to follow the game or the developer, but they cannot download your game.

## Select Game Status

After filling in the basic information of the game, you can select the game’s status.

Go to <Blue>Store</Blue> >> <Blue>Store Settings</Blue>. After you have selected the status for your game, you will need to submit it for review. The status will only be effective after it passes the review.

    Let players participate in the test of your game to collect feedback and suggestions. 

4. Open for Download

    Your game will be available for download after it is released.

4.1 **The TapTap Platform is a neutral service provider which only provides Game-related services to Developers, including neutral network service or technical support, e.g. uploading and storage, Game release, pre-registering, testing, and transfer to links, so that Developers can release and promote their Games independently on the platform.**

4.2 **With regard to the Developer’s Games, the Developer shall develop and/or operate them independently, have a legal license and assume all responsibilities for such Games.

5.3 You may authorize Users to reinstall each Game downloaded via the TapTap Platform multiple times, unless the Game is removed by you or TapTap.

 

## **6. Your Use of the TapTap Platform**

6.1 You agree to submit the Games to TapTap for release no later than the first commercial release of each Game or Localized Version, or, if already commercially released before the Effective Date, within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date. Thereafter, you shall submit to TapTap any Localized Versions and updated versions (in beta and final form) when available, but in no event later than they are provided to any other third party for commercial release. 

6.2 Except for the licensing rights granted under this Agreement or a separate agreement entered into between you and TapTap, TapTap will not obtain the rights, ownership or interests of Games from you (or your licensor), including the current intellectual property rights in or to such Games.

6.3 You agree to use the TapTap Platform only when permitted by this Agreement and any applicable laws or regulations or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdiction.

6.4 You agree to protect the privacy and legal rights of Users when using the Service, at least to the degree, in principle, as set forth in the TapTap [Privacy Policy](https://www.taptap.io/privacy-policy). If your protection is obviously inferior to that degree, you shall inform the User and obtain his/her consent. For example, if Users provide their username, password, or other login information or personal information in order to access or use your Games, then you must not only let the Users know that such information will only be used for your Games, but also provide them with a privacy statement and sufficient protections. In addition, your Games can only use such information for the limited purposes permitted by Users. If your Games contain personal or sensitive information provided by Users, it must be stored securely and used or disclosed according to the local laws and regulations and the relevant national or regional standards. However, if Users choose to sign a separate agreement with you, which allows you or your Games to store or use their personal or sensitive information directly related to your Games (excluding other Games), then your use of such information will be subject to the said agreement. If Users provide the information of TapTap accounts or other accounts for your Games, then your Games can only use such information to access such accounts, and only for the limited purposes, as permitted by them. You shall inform Users of the manner to modify or delete User Data, ensure that Users can act in that manner by themselves when they request to delete their User Data, and that such data is completely deleted.

6.5 You agree that you will not engage in or participate in any interference, interruption, destruction or unauthorized access to any third-party equipment, server, network or other property or service when using the TapTap Platform or the Service. This provision also applies to Game development or release. You shall not use any User information obtained from the TapTap Platform to sell or release Games outside of the TapTap Platform, nor provide data obtained from the TapTap Platform in any form to another party, nor sell or transfer customer information. Without the prior written consent of TapTap, you shall not use the relevant data for purposes other than stipulated in this Agreement.

6.6 **You agree that you are solely responsible for the consequences of any Games you release on the TapTap Platform and that use any API or TapSDK; TapTap will not bear any responsibility to you or any third party. These consequences include, but are not limited to, responsibilities, consumer protection and/or intellectual property responsibilities related to your Games.**

6.7 **You agree to take full responsibility for all violations of the obligations as set forth in this Agreement, any applicable third-party contract or service provisions, or any applicable laws or regulations, and the consequences thereof (TapTap shall be held irresponsible to you or any third party). If the Games you release on the TapTap Platform have defects in rights or infringes upon the legal rights of a third party (including without limitation patent rights, trademark rights, copyrights and adjacent copyrights, portrait rights, personal information rights, privacy rights, and reputation rights), which subject the TapTap Platform and its affiliates or the third parties that cooperate with the TapTap Platform (“indemnified parties”) to any claim or suit, or cause the indemnified parties to suffer any loss of reputation or property, you shall take all possible measures to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified parties against such claims and suits. At the same time, you shall be fully liable for the direct and indirect financial losses borne by the indemnified parties.**

6.8 You agree to classify your Games according to the local laws and regulations, or relevant policies and industry standards. **All legal consequences and losses caused by the improper classification you declare shall be borne by you, and you shall compensate TapTap for all resulting losses.**

6.9 Users may rate and review Games on the TapTap Platform. You agree that you shall not artificially manipulate the user evaluation system for Games. TapTap has the right to determine or change the position of Games displayed on the TapTap Platform at its own discretion, and to display Games and their ratings and reviews to Users in a manner determined by TapTap.

6.10 You are responsible for uploading your Games to the TapTap Platform, providing Users with the necessary information and support, and accurately disclosing the necessary security permissions to ensure the normal operation of your Games on Users’ devices. If your Games are not uploaded normally, they will not be released on the TapTap Platform. Your Games shall meet TapTap's requirements in technology and security to ensure their safety and stable operation on the TapTap Platform. At the same time, in order to provide Users with high-quality Products and services, **you shall continuously update your Games after they are launched and in operation (including without limitation downloading, test, and trial), and ensure that the Game version on the TapTap Platform is the latest version available via various public channels. That means the Game version you provide to the TapTap Platform shall not be lower than that on any other Android Game platform or channel regardless of whether the Game version on other platforms or channels is provided by you or a third party with your authorization**.

6.11 You shall provide relevant holders with an effective complaint channel to ensure that they can claim rights against you when they believe that you have infringed upon their legal rights and interests. 

6.12 You shall not bypass, attempt to bypass, or claim to be able to bypass any content protection systems or data analysis tools provided by TapTap, or intentionally mislead Users into making them believe that they are directly interacting with TapTap.

6.13 In order to provide you with more comprehensive and high-quality services, TapTap or its partners ("providers of individual services") may also provide you with other individual services, including without limitation advertising and TapSDK (or API) service. You have the right to decide by yourself whether or not to use such individual services as appropriate.

If you do not accept the said change or amendment, you shall stop using the relevant service. Otherwise, if you continue to use such service, it shall be deemed that you have agreed and accepted such change or amendment.

6.17 The Games that you publish on the TapTap Platform or for which you use the Services shall be in compliance with the TapTap policies, all applicable laws and other obligations worldwide. You shall declare and guarantee that the Games you release shall not contain the following content or behavior:

- Content in violation of local laws and regulations;
- Content that is harmful to children, such as pornographic content related to minors, excessive violence and blood, and content that depicts or encourages harmful and dangerous activities;

## **8. Intellectual Property Rights**

8.1 Each party has all its rights, ownership and interests, including but not limited to all intellectual property rights in or to its Brand Marking. Except for the limited scope expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither party shall grant any rights, ownership or interests (including without limitation any implied license) contained in or related to any Brand Marking to the other party; nor shall the other party acquire such rights, ownership or interests. According to this Agreement, the Developer grants TapTap and its affiliates a non-exclusive, limited license during the term of this Agreement to release Games on the TapTap Platform or fulfill their obligations under this Agreement and display the Developer’s Brand Marking submitted by the Developer to the TapTap Platform online or on mobile devices. Nothing in this Agreement grants the Developer the right to use any trade name, trademark, service mark, logo, domain name or other unique Brand Marking of the TapTap Platform.

## **9. Game Removal**

9.1 Game removal by the Developer. Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing between you and TapTap, you may apply to terminate release of Games to Users on the TapTap Platform (“removal”) if: (a) you decide to terminate operation of the Games; and (b) you have removed the Games from all other Android platforms or channels, or ensure that the Games are not removed from such other platforms or channels later than from the TapTap Platform. You shall notify the TapTap Platform of your decision in writing 90 days earlier, stating the reason for removal, the plan for or the status of such Games on other platforms or channels, and the date such Games are to be removed from the TapTap Platform. The Games can be removed after confirmation by TapTap and fulfillment of the relevant procedures.

Regardless of the reason, if you need to terminate your Games, you shall post an announcement of termination to Users on the Game-related page at least 60 days in advance according to the relevant regulations, and close the payment portal. The announcement shall be posted until the day of such termination.

The removal of the Game: (a) will not affect the license of Users who have purchased or downloaded the Games; (b) will not result in any removal of such Games from the devices of Users who have acquired the Games; and (c) will not change your obligations of distribution or support to Users who have purchased or downloaded Games or services.

9.2 Game removal by TapTap Platform. Although TapTap is not obliged to monitor the content of Games, if via your notifications, third-party complaints, User complaints, institutional supervision or other means, TapTap learns that your Games, including any part of them, or your Brand Marking: (a) infringe upon the intellectual property rights or any other rights of a third party; (b) are in violation of any applicable law or prohibition order; (c) are released improperly by you; (d) may subject TapTap or its authorized operators to legal liabilities; (e) are deemed by TapTap to carry a virus, or as malware or spyware, or to have adverse effects on TapTap or its authorized operators’ network; (f) are in violation of this Agreement or other agreements, terms or rules intended for the Developer; or (g) are displayed with effects on the integrity of the TapTap Platform server (that is to say Users cannot access the TapTap Platform, the Games, or encounter other difficulties in accessing the foregoing content), then TapTap may decide at its own discretion to remove the Game from the TapTap Platform, or re-classify and re-rate the Games.

If you have violated any agreement reached with, or any rule disclosed by, the TapTap Platform, TapTap may restrict, suspend or terminate any Service provided to you, including removal of your Games, according to relevant agreements and rules. TapTap reserves the right to restrict, suspend and/or prohibit any Developer from using any Service of the TapTap Platform at its sole discretion. If your Games contain elements that may seriously damage Users’ devices or data, TapTap may disable the Games or remove the related Game package or disconnect the related link at its sole discretion.

If your Game is removed from TapTap Platform due to above reasons and a User purchased such Game within a year (or a longer period as local consumer law mandates) before the date of removal, you agree to refund to the User all amounts paid by such User for such Game.

9.3 **You hereby confirm and agree that Game reviews, ratings and posts are regarded as User Data, and the rights therein or thereto shall belong to Users or/and the TapTap Platform. If any third party uses User Data by reprinting or copying them without authorization, TapTap has the right to maintain the rights in its own name, including without limitation by sending a notice, filing a lawsuit and issuing an administrative complaint. In order to protect the rights and interests of related Users, TapTap has the right to retain the pages related to the removed Games, including all Product information, User reviews, Game ratings, news and forum content after removal, except that it will no longer provide service related to Game downloads.**
